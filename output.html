<h1 id="trench-crusade-playtest-rules">TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST
RULES</h1>
<h2 id="playtest-rules">Playtest rules</h2>
<p>Trench Crusade is a skirmish-scale tabletop miniature game that will
plunge players deep into a horrifying alternate timeline. During the
Crusades a heretical band of Templars dared defy the Almighty. Casting
aside their sacred vows they unleashed the forces of Hell upon the
Earth.</p>
<p>Over 800 years later, in the Year of Our Lord 1914, this brutal,
merciless war between the forces of Heaven and Hell rages on. This is
not merely a fight for survival – it is a cataclysmic struggle that will
decide the very fate of humanity’s soul.</p>
<p>The following rules will immerse you in the trenches, guiding your
warband through fierce skirmish battles as you vie for supremacy in No
Man’s Land.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need-to-play"><u>What You Need To Play</u></h3>
<h4 id="miniatures">Miniatures</h4>
<p>Each player commands a Warband, which typically consists of 6-20
models. While there is no ironclad rule on the scale of models, the
heroic 32mm scale is what we use in our games. If you prefer another
scale, do not worry – Witchburners will not be dispatched to cleanse you
for your lack of scale purity!</p>
<h4 id="tabletop">Tabletop</h4>
<p>You will also need a gaming surface to play on. We suggest two
surface sizes for games: 48” x 48” or 36” x 36”. This allows the game to
be played on a typical kitchen table.</p>
<h4 id="terrain">Terrain</h4>
<p>Terrain is also necessary, and the more you have of it, the better!
Trench Crusade is a game of position and tactics, so different types of
elevation, cover and varied terrain pieces will all enhance your gaming
experience.</p>
<h4 id="measuring-tool">Measuring tool</h4>
<p>To measure distances, you will need a tape measure or measuring
stick. Trench Crusade uses the Imperial measurement system which means
movement is measured in inches.</p>
<h4 id="dice">Dice</h4>
<p>Next, you will require dice. Each player should have eight 6-sided
dice (D6s) in their own distinct colours.</p>
<h4 id="blood-marker-dice">Blood Marker Dice</h4>
<p>Finally, you will need a few red 6-sided dice to represent</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>(explained in the rules below).</p>
<h3 id="game-turn-activations"><u>Game Turn &amp; Activations</u></h3>
<p>Players <strong>Activate </strong>their models in alternating order.
A single <strong>Turn </strong>consists of both players Activating all
their models once.</p>
<p>For example, the first player will choose a model to Activate, take
any <em>ACTIONS </em>available to the model, and then it is time for the
next player to activate one of their models.</p>
<p>You can then choose any model in your warband (that has not yet been
Activated) and Activate that model. This model can now Move, take
<em>ACTIONS </em>and use special skills and equipment as you see fit.
When your model’s Activation is over, your opponent can then Activate
one of their models and so on.</p>
<p>The player with the <strong>lowest </strong>number of models
currently remaining on the table will decide who will start with the
first Activation at the beginning of each Turn. If both players have the
same number of models, roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest gets to
decide.</p>
<p>When each player has Activated all their models, the Turn is
over.</p>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>Once Activated a model can take as many or as few <em>ACTIONS
</em>during each Activation as you wish, in any order you choose.
However, each <em>ACTION </em>can only be taken once per Activation
unless otherwise stated in the rules. Thus you could fire your weapon,
then Move and then Dash during the same Activation, or Dash and then
Charge and so on.</p>
<p>Common <em>ACTIONS </em>that all models can take are listed</p>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong></p>
<p>Many weapons, troop types, equipment and armour have associated
Keywords. These are always depicted clearly in capital letters. For
example, all large and cumbersome weapons have the</p>
<p>Keyword <em>HEAVY</em>. This allows</p>
<p>the player to separate lore and general descriptions from rules.
Thus, if the rules dictate that “No model carrying a <em>HEAVY
</em>weapon can add D6 to their</p>
<p>charge move”, this applies to every single weapon with said Keyword.
Refer to the Keywords section on page 12 for the full list to see their
effects on gameplay.</p>
<p>below. Be sure to consult the profile of each warrior in your warband
to see what <em>ACTIONS </em>their abilities allow them to perform in
addition to these.</p>
<p>Several <em>ACTIONS </em>require you to roll on the <strong>Action
Success Chart </strong>(see below) to see if you succeed. If you
succeed, you take the <em>ACTION </em>as described in the rules. If you
fail, you can still move or take any other</p>
<p><em>ACTIONS </em>the model may have. If the <em>ACTION </em>is
classed as a <em>RISKY ACTION </em>and you fail, the activation of the
model is over and your opponent can now activate one of their
models!</p>
<p>; <strong>Move</strong>: When a model takes this <em>ACTION
</em>during its activation, choose one of the three options below. The
Move <em>ACTION </em>does not require a roll on the <strong>Action
Success Chart</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Move</strong>: The model moves up to its Movement
characteristic.</p>
<p><strong>Charge</strong>: Choose an enemy model (that the charging
model can see) within 12” as the target. The charging model then moves
directly toward that target via the shortest and most effective route
possible determined by distance, with</p>
<p>a D6” bonus to its Movement characteristic. This movement can allow
the charging model to move within 1” of the target, putting the two
models in Melee Combat with each other. A model cannot Charge if they
have taken the Make a Ranged Attack <em>ACTION </em>during this
Activation, unless they made a single ranged attack with a weapon that
has the Keyword <em>ASSAULT</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Retreat</strong>: The model moves up to its Movement
characteristic and it may leave Melee Combat during this movement. Each
enemy model in Melee Combat with the retreating model may immediately
take a Melee Attack <em>ACTION </em>with a single melee weapon that it
has. Resolve the effects of this attack before moving the retreating
model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Dash</strong>: The model must succeed with a <em>RISKY
ACTION</em>. If successful, the model takes the Standard Move <em>ACTION
</em>as described above. This can be done in addition to any other
<em>ACTION</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Make a Ranged Attack</strong>: The model may shoot with a
ranged weapon that it is equipped with. A model engaged in Melee Combat
cannot shoot. A model cannot make a Ranged Attack during an</p>
<p>Activation in which they have Charged, unless they made a single
ranged attack with a weapon that has the Keyword <em>ASSAULT</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Make a Melee Attack</strong>: If the model is engaged</p>
<p>in Melee combat, it may attack as detailed in the Melee Weapon’s
entry in the rules. The attacker must be able to see at least part of
the target – no Melee attacks through walls!</p>
<p>; <strong>Any other </strong><em>ACTIONS</em>: Many models have other
possible <em>ACTIONS </em>they can take during their Activations. Refer
to the Warband Lists for details.</p>
<p><strong>Risky Actions</strong>: If you fail a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>,
this always ends the activation of the model and your opponent can now
activate one of their models!</p>
<h2 id="dice-and--dice"><u>+Dice and -Dice</u></h2>
<p>Rules often have modifiers to dice rolls marked as</p>
<p><em>+DICE </em>and <em>-DICE </em>(for example, shooting from
elevated positions adds <em>+1 DICE </em>to ranged attacks against
enemies below). These are shown in the format of</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE </em>and <em>-1 DICE</em>. Many models have them on their
profile for Melee and Ranged attacks, and things like range, cover and
so on can apply them to the dice rolls you make on the <strong>Action
Success Chart </strong>or <strong>Injury Chart</strong>. For each
<em>+DICE</em>, add one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are
about to make. Thus <em>+1 DICE </em>makes the roll a total of 3D6. Then
roll all the dice and pick the two <strong>highest </strong>numbers. If
two <em>+DICE </em>are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two highest and so
on.</p>
<p>The <em>-DICE </em>works in reverse. For each <em>-1 DICE</em>, add
one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are about to make. Thus
<em>-1 DICE </em>makes the roll a total of 3D6. Then roll all the dice
and pick the two <strong>lowest </strong>numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-measuring</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="791bbac6096136b4c57867aec27437d09e024fe9.png"
style="width:4.39792in;height:6.35347in" alt="image" /></strong></p>
<p>Unless the rules specifically tell you otherwise, you are allowed to
measure distances to see if you are in range for shooting, charging and
so on.</p>
<p><u>Action Success Chart</u></p>
<p>When you take an <em>ACTION </em>(including Melee and Ranged
Attacks), roll 2D6 and add any</p>
<p><em>+DICE </em>or <em>-DICE </em>from the character’s profile,
injuries or other sources, pick the two highest (or lowest if any
<em>-DICE </em>were applied) and consult the chart below to see if the
<em>ACTION </em>succeeded:</p>
<p>If you succeed, you take the <em>ACTION </em>as described in the
rules. If you fail, you can still move or take any other <em>ACTIONS
</em>the model may have access to. If the <em>ACTION </em>fails, and it
was <em>RISKY</em>, the model’s Activation ends immediately.</p>
<p><strong>2-6 Failure</strong></p>
<p><strong>7-11 Success</strong></p>
<p><strong>12+ Critical success</strong>: Ranged and Melee Attacks add
+1 DICE to injury</p>
<p>rolls if your result is a Critical Success when determining if they
hit.</p>
<p><strong>Climbing &amp; Jumping</strong></p>
<p>During any movement made by a model, it can climb surfaces, jump
across gaps and down ledges to navigate the battlefield. Climbing up and
down surfaces or jumping across gaps costs movement as normal. Jumping
down doesn’t cost movement but might be dangerous based on the height of
the jump (see page 7 for detailed rules).</p>
<p>If <em>-2 DICE </em>are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two lowest and
so on.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gameplay example: </em></strong><em>A Trench Pilgrim
model is shooting at a Heretic trooper with a musket. The Heretic is in
cover, which grants -1 DICE to any ranged attacks. The Pilgrim rolls 3D6
and gets 5, 5 and 1. The two lowest numbers are picked for a result of
6. As the Pilgrim needed 7 to hit, the shot missed!</em></p>
<p>Before rolling dice, add any <em>+DICE </em>and <em>-DICE </em>to the
dice pool. If the pool contains both <em>+DICE </em>and <em>-DICE</em>,
remove pairs of opposite dice until only one type is remaining.</p>
<h3 id="blood-markers"><u>Blood Markers</u></h3>
<p>During a battle your warriors can be wounded due to enemy attacks,
the use of supernatural powers, falling from great heights and so on –
see the <strong>Injury Chart </strong>for details. This damage is
tracked via <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>. In</p>
<p>addition to wounds, they represent exhaustion, concussion,
shellshock, physical and mental strain and so on.</p>
<p>Each time one of your models suffers such damage, place a <em>BLOOD
MARKER </em>(red dice) next to the model to track this damage. Use the
pip number on each dice to indicate the number of <em>BLOOD MARKERS
</em>the model has. Every time this model takes an <em>ACTION
</em>(shooting, melee attacks and so on), your opponent can declare that
they are spending one or more <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>it has to add
<em>-1 DICE </em>to the dice pool when the roll on the <strong>Action
Success Chart </strong>is made. Multiple markers can be applied to any
single roll if the target model has multiple <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>to
be converted.</p>
<p>The <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>can also be used by your opponent when the
model suffers damage from any source. Each marker can be converted into
<em>+1 DICE </em>on the <strong>Injury Chart </strong>roll, making a
serious injury far more likely and, just like with <em>ACTIONS</em>,
multiple markers can be used to influence a single roll on the
<strong>Injury Chart</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading" id="bloodbath">BLOODBATH</p>
<p>You can roll an additional D6 on injury rolls at the cost of six
<em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>on any model, or at the cost of three <em>BLOOD
MARKERS </em>if the target is <em>Down</em>. This means that instead of
rolling 2D6 on your typical weapon, you roll 3D6 on your injury roll and
add the</p>
<p>numbers together. Weapons such as the Artillery Witch’s Infernal Bomb
would therefore roll 4D6 and add the results together (3D6+1D6).</p>
<p><em><strong>Gameplay</strong> <strong>Example:</strong> </em>**<em>A
Trench Pilgrim model has sustained a wound during the battle and has two
BLOOD MARKERS on them. A Heretic Trooper shoots at the Pilgrim with his
trusty bolt action rifle, rolls an 8 and</em></p>
<p><em>hits! The Heretic player decides to use one of the BLOOD MARKERS
to make the shot more likely to injure. The Heretic player rolls 3D6
(2D6 +1 DICE from the spent marker) and consults the Injury Chart. The
result is 4, 5 and 1. Since one +DICE was used, the player picks the two
highest numbers which total 9. The Pilgrim is taken out of
action!</em></p>
<h3 id="blessing-markers"><u>Blessing Markers</u></h3>
<p><em>BLESSING MARKERS </em>are similar to <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>.
Supernatural powers, holy relics and many other sources may grant these
to a model, which can then be expended to aid the <em>ACTIONS </em>of
the model.</p>
<p>Every time the model takes an <em>ACTION </em>(shooting, dashing,
melee attacks and so on), you can declare that they are spending one or
more of any <em>BLESSING</em></p>
<p><em>MARKERS </em>the model has. You can add <em>+1 DICE </em>to the
dice pool when any roll on the <strong>Action Success Chart </strong>is
made. Additionally, whenever the opponent makes an injury roll against a
model, that model may spend a <em>BLESSING MARKER </em>to apply a <em>-1
DICE </em>penalty to</p>
<p>that injury roll. Multiple <em>BLESSING MARKERS </em>can be applied
to any single roll if the target model has more than one <em>BLESSING
MARKER</em>.</p>
<h3 id="movement"><u>Movement</u></h3>
<p>All models in the game can Move when Activated unless otherwise
indicated in the rules. Each model can move up to the number of inches
indicated in their profile, though they can move less and not at all if
you wish.</p>
<p>There are a number of general rules that apply to all of the movement
that a model takes during its Activation. Certain types of movement,
such as <em>Falling </em>or the knockback effect of an Artillery Witch’s
Infernal Bomb, are not subject to these rules. Regardless of the
type</p>
<p>of movement, a model cannot move off the battlefield unless a rule
specifically states so.</p>
<p>; A model cannot enter Melee Combat (within 1” of enemy models)
unless it Charges.</p>
<p>; A model cannot leave Melee Combat (within 1”</p>
<p>of enemy models) at any point during Movement</p>
<p>unless it is Retreating.</p>
<p>; A model in Melee Combat cannot otherwise</p>
<p>move unless they began their Activation in Melee Combat, take the
standard Move <em>ACTION </em>and remain in Melee Combat with every
model that they were in Melee Combat with at the start of their</p>
<p>Activation.</p>
<p>; A model can move through friendly models if it</p>
<p>has enough movement to move past them entirely.</p>
<p>; A model cannot move off the battlefield unless a</p>
<p><strong>Denied Rule</strong></p>
<p>A situation may occur where different rules and abilities conflict
with each other creating a rules impasse. A rule might require a model
to do something, while another rule says it cannot do this. In these
situations the prohibition takes precedence. If a model cannot do
something, this</p>
<p>overrides any rule that says it must do another action.</p>
<p><strong>Fractions</strong></p>
<p>In all cases where the rules refer to fractions, always round up to
the nearest whole number when necessary. For example, if your warband
has nine models and the rule calls for something to effect half of the
entire force, round</p>
<p>4.5 models up to 5. On the other hand, if a model with a Move- ment
characteristic of 9” had its movement halved, that could become 4.5”
without needing to round to a whole number.</p>
<p><strong>Going Over the Top</strong></p>
<p>All trenches are considered to have fire steps and footholds, and
therefore climbing out of them requires no RISKY ACTION test.</p>
<figure>
<img src="f28c9e6078903818918ea3c01adaa7e30d25c9cd.png"
style="width:3.0125in;height:4.66319in" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>rule specifically states so.</p>
<p>Movement (including charging) is usually the only action a model can
take that does not require you to roll 2D6 to determine whether you are
successful or not, unless otherwise noted in the rules.</p>
<p>; <strong>Charging</strong>: Select an enemy model that is within 12”
of the charging model to be the target. If the charging model does not
have line of sight to its target, it must succeed with a <em>RISKY
ACTION </em>before proceeding. Roll a D6 (the charge roll)</p>
<p>and add it to the charging model’s Movement characteristic (with a
maximum distance of 12”). The charging model must move this distance
toward the target by the shortest and most effective route possible by
distance. Jumping, Climbing or moving through Dangerous Terrain is
always optional during a Charge, even if it is the shortest route,
though the new route avoiding such obstacles must still be as short as
possible.</p>
<p>If after completing this movement the charging model is within 1” of
the target, the charging model is considered to have successfully
charged the target and is now in Melee Combat. If the charging model
does not reach its target, the Charge is considered to have failed, but
it remains where it is after the movement.</p>
<p>; <strong>Charging Multiple Enemies: </strong>A model may target
multiple enemies with a single Charge if there is a space that the
charging model could occupy (within 12”) that would place it in Melee
Combat with every target of its Charge. It still only makes a single
Charge.</p>
<p>; <strong>Interposing Models during a Charge: </strong>If a charging
model would pass within 1” of an enemy model that is not the target of
its Charge, its charge immediately ends and it is considered to have
charged the interposing model instead.</p>
<p>; <strong>Diving Charge: </strong>If a charging model jumps down as
part of a Charge, it landed within 2” of its target and it jumped from a
ledge that was at least 3” (measured from the target’s base) and no more
than 6” (measured from the charging model’s landing space), it may
convert its Charge into a Diving Charge.</p>
<p>Place the charging model in any space within 1” of the target and
take a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. If successful, the charging model gains a
<em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to hit and to injure the target, and the charging
model ignores the target’s Defended Obstacle bonus (if it has one) for
the remainder of its Activation. If the <em>RISKY ACTION </em>fails, the
model is Down and is injured as per the rules for Falling.</p>
<p>; <strong>Climbing</strong>: A model can move up or down ladders,
ramps, ropes, stairs and other devices meant for climbing as a normal
part of any movement it takes. This costs movement as normal. As a
<em>RISKY ACTION</em>, a model may also attempt to climb up or down
sheer surfaces, such as walls, but it must have enough remaining
movement to clear the entire height. If this <em>RISKY ACTION
</em>fails, the model remains where it is.</p>
<p>; <strong>Jumping Over Gaps</strong>: As a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>, a
model can jump across a gap of up to half their movement characteristic
(measured horizontally).</p>
<p>This costs movement as normal and can be taken as any kind of
movement that the model has. A model cannot attempt to jump a gap that
it does not have enough movement to clear. If this <em>RISKY ACTION
</em>fails, the model falls as if it fell from a ledge on either side of
the gap of the opponent’s choice.</p>
<p>; <strong>Jumping Between Ledges of Unequal Heights</strong>: If the
ledge that the model is jumping to is lower than the ledge that it is
jumping from, apply the rules for Jumping Down after the model jumps the
gap. If the ledge that the model is jumping to is higher than the ledge
that it is jumping from, it can only be up to 1” higher and, if that
ledge is at least</p>
<p>½” higher, the jump costs an extra 1” of movement.</p>
<p>; <strong>Jumping Down</strong>: A model can voluntarily ‘fall’ from
a ledge that it is in base contact with. This never costs movement and
can be done as part of any movement that the model has. Additionally,
when falling from heights of up to 3” in this way, it does not make an
injury roll.</p>
<h6 id="falling">Falling</h6>
<p>When a model falls, it is moved from its current position to the
first space that it can occupy directly beneath it or the ledge that it
fell from. If it fell from a height greater than 2”, it must roll on the
<strong>Injury Chart</strong>. For every 3” fallen, add <em>+1 DICE
</em>to this injury roll (for example, a fall of 3” would be rolled with
<em>+1 DICE </em>and a fall of 6” with <em>+2 DICE</em>).</p>
<p>A model can fall through its own action, such as when it fails a
<em>RISKY ACTION </em>when jumping over gaps</p>
<p>or when jumping down a distance greater than 3”. A model in an
elevated position may also fall when it is Downed while within 1” of a
ledge. When this happens, the model takes an <em>ACTION</em>. If it
succeeds, the model remains Downed where it is. If it fails, the model
falls from the nearest ledge.</p>
<p><strong>Model Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to making sure the models in your game match their
stated size, actual</p>
<p>equipment, weapons and armour, we recommend the following maxim:</p>
<p><strong>“Be strict with yourself but lenient with
others”.</strong></p>
<h6 id="terrain-1">Terrain</h6>
<p>There are four types of terrain in Trench Crusade:
<strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Difficult</strong>, <strong>Dangerous
</strong>and <strong>Impassable</strong>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Open</strong>: Open terrain is the most common terrain is
Trench Crusade. Models can move freely through Open terrain. This
includes crossing obstacles of up to 1” high, which does not cost
movement. Ladders</p>
<p>and ramps are open terrain.</p>
<p>; <strong>Difficult</strong>: This includes rock beds, swamps,</p>
<p>barbed wire and so on. Moving through Difficult Terrain costs double
the normal movement of the</p>
<p>model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Dangerous</strong>: This includes barbed wire,</p>
<p>minefields, raging fires, areas covered in poisonous gas and so on.
Whenever a model moves into, or starts its Activation in, Dangerous
Terrain, it must take an <em>ACTION</em>. On a failure, make an
injury</p>
<p>roll for the model. If the model moved into the</p>
<p>Dangerous Terrain, this <em>ACTION </em>is <em>RISKY</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Impassable</strong>: Models cannot pass through</p>
<p>Impassable terrain.</p>
<p>Terrain can be both Difficult and Dangerous.</p>
<h6 id="movement-types">Movement types</h6>
<p>There exist two movement types currently in Trench Crusade: Infantry
and Flying. A model can only have one movement type. If it gains a
movement of another type, it must choose which movement it keeps.</p>
<p>; <strong>Infantry</strong>: This movement type covers every model
that walks, crawls or gallops along the ground. Models with this
movement type obey all of</p>
<p>the typical rules for movement.</p>
<p>; <strong>Flying</strong>: This movement type covers every</p>
<p>model that flies with wings, floats with magic or otherwise hovers
above the ground. Flying models treat Difficult and/or Dangerous Terrain
as Open Terrain and they do not trigger mines and similar devices.
Flying models can climb up and down and they can jump over gaps of up to
their Movement characteristic without taking <em>ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<h3 id="combat"><u>Combat</u></h3>
<p>Combat is divided into <strong>Ranged </strong>and <strong>Melee
</strong>Combat. A model may fight in Melee Combat or with any ranged
weapons it has.</p>
<h6 id="ranged-attacks">Ranged Attacks</h6>
<p>To shoot at an enemy, a model must have a ranged weapon and be able
to see the target. If the model has multiple ranged weapons, you can
shoot one of them per Activation. The only way to check what your model
can</p>
<p>see is to stoop over the tabletop for a model’s eye view for actual
line of sight.</p>
<p>Models in Melee combat cannot shoot unless the rules of the weapon
indicate otherwise. Some indirect fire weapons have rules that allow you
to target models even out of sight – these are clearly explained in the
profile for such weapons. Models can see all around themselves (i.e.
360°) and they may be turned freely to face any direction before
firing.</p>
<p>When making a ranged attack follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose one Ranged Weapon <em>ACTION</em>, declare a target and
check line of sight.</p></li>
<li><p>Check if the target is in range of the weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine and apply any <em>+/- DICE </em>that affect the
shot.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll on the <strong>Action Success Chart </strong>as
standard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you hit the enemy, roll on the <strong>Injury Chart
</strong>(see below). Determine and apply any <em>+/- DICE </em>that
affect the injury roll.</p></li>
<li><p>If the weapon can shoot multiple times per Activation, resolve
the shots one at a time.</p></li>
</ol>
<h6 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h6>
<p>; <strong>Enemy behind Cover: </strong>Add <em>-1 DICE </em>to the
roll. A model is in cover whenever it is in contact with a piece of
scenery that is at least as long as the model’s base. If an attacker can
see a model in its entirety, this penalty does not apply. A model cannot
gain cover merely from being obscured due to angles, distant scenery or
the surface that they are standing on (such as when standing on top of a
building).</p>
<p>; <strong>Long Range: </strong>If the target is more than half the
weapon’s maximum range, add <em>-1 DICE </em>to the roll to determine if
the attack hits.</p>
<p>; <strong>Shooting from an elevated position: </strong>Add <em>+1
DICE </em>to hit rolls if the model is taking the shot from a position
more than 2” above the target’s ground level (being the floor on which
the target’s base rests on). If the target is on a 50mm or larger base,
the height must be 4” from the target’s ground level.</p>
<p><strong>Shooting into Melee</strong></p>
<p>If you shoot at any models engaged in melee (from a position outside
the melee itself ), roll a D6 for each shot (or automatic hit) to
determine which model is hit: On a 1-3, the attack targets one of your
models at random within 1” of the target, on a 4-6, the attack targets
an enemy model at random within 1” of the target. Resolve the attack as
normal once the target is determined.</p>
<p>You are <strong>not </strong>allowed to shoot (unless otherwise
noted) if engaged in melee yourself.</p>

the model’s profile or other sources), pick the two highest (or lowest
if any <em>-DICE </em>were applied) and consult the following table:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: On occasion, a rule will ask you to total more
(or less) than 2D6 to determine the outcome of a roll. If the dice roll
is modified by</p>
<p><em>+/- DICE</em>, modify the dice pool as normal and keep the
highest or lowest number of dice equal to the number of dice in the
starting dice pool. For example, if the rule asked you to roll a total
of 3D6 with <em>+1 DICE</em>, you would roll four dice and keep and
total the highest three dice.</p>
<p>Modifiers to <strong>Injury Chart </strong>rolls (cumulative):</p>
<p>; <strong>Trench Shield</strong>: -1 to injury rolls (can be combined
with any Armour)</p>
<p>; <strong>Standard Armour</strong>: -1 to injury rolls</p>
<p>; <strong>Reinforced Armour</strong>: -2 to injury rolls</p>
<p>; <strong>Machine Armour</strong>: -3 to injury rolls (not</p>
<p>cumulative with a shield)</p>
<p>; <em>TOUGH</em>: If a <em>TOUGH </em>model would be</p>
<p>taken Out Of Action, it is knocked <em>Down </em>instead. After a
<em>TOUGH </em>model has been knocked <em>Down </em>in this way once, it
can be</p>
<p>taken Out of Action as normal.</p>
<p>; <strong>Target is Down</strong>: Add <em>+1 DICE </em>to the</p>
<p>dice pool when determining injuries for a</p>
<p>model that is <em>Down</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Bloodbath</strong>: Roll an additional D6</p>
<p>and add it to the injury roll total. Costs six <em>BLOOD MARKERS
</em>(three if the target is <em>Down</em>).</p>
<p class="heading" id="no-effect">No Effect</p>
<p>The armour of the target withstands the hit. There is no effect.</p>
<p class="heading" id="minor-hit">Minor Hit</p>
<p>Add <em>+1 BLOOD MARKER </em>next to the model to represent a wound.
Use the dice pips to count the</p>
<p>hits inflicted (maximum six per model). Whenever the wounded model
takes an</p>
<p><em>ACTION</em>, the opponent can decide to spend one</p>
<p>or more of the <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>to add <em>-1 DICE </em>to the
roll for each of them (i.e. roll 3D6 and pick the two lowest results if
you use one marker).</p>
<p>When rolling on the <strong>Injury Chart </strong>against this model,
the opponent can spend one or more of the <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>to add
<em>+1 DICE </em>to the roll for each pip. This makes a severe injury
more likely. When you attack a wounded model, you can spend one or more
of the markers to add <em>+1 DICE </em>to the attack roll for each
marker.</p>
<p class="heading" id="warrior-down">Warrior Down!</p>
<p>Place +1 <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>next to the model and the model goes
<em>Down</em>. If the model is already <em>Down</em>, it instead suffers
+2 <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>and remains <em>Down</em>. A model that is
<em>Down </em>suffers a <em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to all of its
<em>ACTIONS</em>. Also it cannot move during its Activation through its
own <em>ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Down </em>condition can either be represented by placing an
indicator next to the model (such as a scrap of paper) or by physically
turning the model face-down on its side. A model turned on its side will
present a different profile for Line-of-Sight targeting, but these two
methods of indication are otherwise identical and the model’s controller
may decide which to use.</p>
<p>At the start of its own Activation, a Downed warrior can Stand, but
any movement (Move, Dash, Charge, Jump, Climb etc.) it can take is
halved. If a model is Downed during its own Activation, it may attempt a
<em>RISKY ACTION </em>in order to Stand. Otherwise, it remains <em>Down
</em>for the remainder of its Activation.</p>
<p class="heading" id="out-of-action">Out of Action</p>
<p>The warrior suffers a major wound and is out of the game for the rest
of the battle – remove the model from the table. Resolve what has
happened to the model after the battle as explained in the <em>Serious
Injuries </em>section of the rules.</p>

<h6 id="melee-combat">Melee Combat</h6>
<p>An activated model can use any of its Melee <em>ACTIONS </em>if it is
in contact with (i.e. within 1” of ) one or more enemies. Select any
melee weapon or attack action available to the model – these are clearly
indicated in the characteristics of each weapon entry.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Declare which melee action you are taking and what opposing model
you are targeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll on the <strong>Action Success Chart </strong>using any melee
attacks available to the model. Add any <em>+/- DICE </em>from any
source such as <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>, profile of the warrior making the
attack etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If the result is successful, roll on the <strong>Injury Chart
</strong>to determine what happens to the target (unless some Equipment
or Special Ability of the model indicates otherwise).</p></li>
</ol>
<h6 id="modifiers-1">Modifiers</h6>
<p>; <strong>Defended obstacle: </strong>Add <em>-1 DICE </em>to the
roll. The target of a melee attack is considered to be defending an
obstacle if it is not Down, it is</p>
<p>touching an obstacle, that obstacle is at least ½” high (measured
from the target’s base) and that obstacle is between it and its
attacker. Common examples of such obstacles are stone walls, earthen
ramparts and trenches. Simple hedges, bushes or low fences are</p>
<p>often not enough.</p>
<p>; <strong>Off-Hand Weapons: </strong>Add <em>-1 DICE </em>to the
roll</p>
<p>if the attack was made with an <em>Off-Hand Weapon</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, each model can only attack once in melee, but some can
execute multiple attacks due to their natural abilities or special
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Two Melee Weapons</strong>: A model armed with two melee
weapons can take two separate Melee Attack <em>ACTIONS</em>, one with
each weapon. One of these weapons, determined before you make your first
<em>ACTION </em>roll,</p>
<p>is an <em>Off-Hand weapon</em>. <em>Off-Hand weapons </em>suffer
<em>-1 DICE </em>to hit.</p>
<p>If a <em>STRONG </em>model wields a two-handed melee weapon in one
hand and a one-handed melee weapon in the other, the one-handed weapon
is always regarded as</p>
<p>the <em>Off-Hand weapon</em>. Resolve attacks made by a model
wielding two melee weapons one at a time, with the <em>Off- Hand weapon
</em>last.</p>
<p><strong>Moving in combat</strong>: If a model is in Melee combat at
the start of their Activation, they may use their Standard Move
<em>ACTION </em>while staying within 1” of the enemies they are engaged
in combat with. This is most often used to negate the Defended Obstacle
bonus. No roll is needed to do this.</p>
<h3 id="end-of-activation"><u>End of Activation</u></h3>
<p>Once you have moved the model and taken all <em>ACTIONS </em>you
wish, or have failed with any of your <em>RISKY ACTIONS</em>, the
Activation of the model ends and your opponent can now Activate one of
their models.</p>
<p>Keep Activating models as long as either player has any inactivated
models left.</p>
<p>Once you and your opponent have Activated all of your models once, go
to the Morale Phase.</p>
<h3 id="morale"><u>Morale</u></h3>
<p>Your warband may abandon the battle if it suffers too many
casualties. At the end of any Turn, when at least half of your warband
is Down or Out of Action, roll on the <strong>Action Success
Chart</strong>.</p>
<p>If you fail, your warband flees the battlefield and loses the battle
immediately. If both warbands are required to take this test, the
smaller warband tests first.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Rule: </strong>A warband that loses a Morale Test
can decide, instead of fleeing, that their warband is <em>Shaken</em>.
Actions taken by models in a <em>Shaken </em>warband are considered
<em>RISKY ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<p>After one turn, the warband recovers to its normal state and is no
longer considered <em>Shaken</em>. If it fails a Morale test again
(shaken or not), it flees as standard.</p>
<h3 id="end-of-turn"><u>End of Turn</u></h3>
<p>Once both players have Activated all the models in their force once,
the turn ends and a new turn begins. The player with the lowest number
of models in their force starts the new turn and selects a model to
activate.</p>

<h1 id="keywords">Keywords</h1>
<p>Keywords define the core abilities, rules, troop types and damage
categories in the game. Each of them is shared by several
models/weapons/equipment and are called out with a Keyword. This makes
it</p>
<p>easy for you to differentiate between descriptive terms and game
rules. A model or a weapon may have multiple Keywords. Rules governing
all Keywords in the game are listed here.</p>
<p><em>+DICE</em>: Modifier for <em>ACTION </em>rolls. For each
<em>+DICE</em>, add one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are
about to make. <em>+1 DICE </em>thus makes the roll a total of 3D6. Then
roll all the dice and pick the two <strong>highest</strong>. If two
<em>+DICE </em>are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two highest, and so
on.</p>
<p><em>-DICE</em>: Modifier for <em>ACTION </em>rolls. For each
<em>-DICE</em>, add one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are
about to make. Thus <em>-1 DICE </em>makes the roll a total of 3D6. Then
roll all the dice and pick the two <strong>lowest</strong>. If two
<em>-DICE </em>are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two lowest, and so
on.</p>
<p><em>ACTION</em>: Covers attacking with Melee and Ranged Weapons,
Dashing and any other activity where the player must roll on the
<strong>Action Success Chart </strong>to make an Action. This roll can
be modified by the opposing player by using <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>. Each
marker causes</p>
<p><em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to the roll.</p>
<p><em>ARTIFICIAL</em>: This model is not of natural origin but is
instead constructed from non-organic elements.</p>
<p><em>ASSAULT</em>: Ranged attacks made with weapons that have this
Keyword do not prevent a model from charging during the same activation.
A charge may only be made if a <strong>single </strong>ranged attack is
made with a weapon with this Keyword, regardless of any other rules that
the weapon might have.</p>
<p><em>BLACK GRAIL</em>: This model is part of the Black Grail
faction.</p>
<p><em>BLAST (X)</em>: A weapon with <em>BLAST (X) </em>has an area of
effect with a radius of inches indicated by X. If this weapon targets a
model, this radius is measured from</p>
<p>the centre of that model’s base in all directions. If this weapon
targets a point on the ground, this radius is measured from that point
in all directions, including vertically. If the Attack <em>ACTION
</em>with this weapon is successful, it hits every model within this
radius that the target (either model or point) has line of sight to
(i.e. not completely blocked by terrain).</p>
<p><em>BLESSING MARKER</em>: Supernatural or chemical temporary
enhancement. Each marker can be converted into <em>+1 DICE </em>for any
<em>ACTION </em>the model takes, or into</p>
<p><em>-1 DICE </em>when rolling injuries for this model.</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKER</em>: Damage inflicted by attacks. Each can be
converted into <em>-1 DICE </em>for any <em>ACTION </em>the wounded
model takes or into <em>+1 DICE </em>when rolling injuries for this
model.</p>
<p><em>CONSUMABLE</em>: An item with this keyword can only be used once.
After the battle, any items with this keyword that were used are
lost.</p>
<p><em>CRITICAL</em>: When attacking with a weapon with this keyword,
add <em>+2 DICE </em>(instead of 1) to any injury rolls the weapon
causes if you roll a Critical (i.e. 12+) on the <strong>Action Success
Chart</strong>.</p>
<p><em>CUMBERSOME</em>: Model always requires two hands to use this
weapon, even if the model has the Keyword <em>STRONG</em>. A weapon with
the Keyword <em>CUMBERSOME</em></p>
<p>ignores this restriction when benefitting from the Shield Combo
rule.</p>
<p><em>ELITE</em>: The most senior and heroic models of the warband.
They have different rules for experience and advancement, and often
enjoy a different weapon, armour and equipment selection.</p>
<p><em>FEAR</em>: Enemies of models with this Keyword suffer <em>-1 DICE
</em>in melee combat against this model. Some units are immune to this
effect. Models that cause <em>FEAR </em>are not affected by <em>FEAR
</em>themselves.</p>
<p><em>FIRE</em>: A model hit by a weapon with this Keyword suffers a
<em>BLOOD MARKER </em>in addition to any other effects of the attack.
The model suffers this <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>even if the attack has no
other effects or is otherwise negated. Some equipment or abilities
can</p>

additional <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>caused by this Keyword.</p>
<p><em>FIRETEAM</em>: This model is part of a Fireteam made up of two
models. All models that are part of this Fireteam can be activated at
the same time without the opponent getting their turn in between. They
can take their</p>
<p><em>ACTIONS </em>in any order they wish, switching between the two
models. Note that if the activation of either member of the Fireteam
forcefully ends (due to a failed <em>RISKY ACTION </em>for example), it
ends both Activations. Allies cannot be part of a Fireteam.</p>
<p><em>GAS</em>: A model hit by a weapon with this Keyword suffers a
<em>BLOOD MARKER</em>, in addition to any other effects of the attack.
The model suffers this <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>even if the attack has no
other effects or is otherwise negated. Some equipment or abilities can
negate the additional <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>caused by this Keyword.</p>
<p><em>GRENADE</em>: Grenade-type weapons ignore penalties for cover and
long range. They do not count towards the number of ranged weapons a
model can carry and do not have to be held in your hand at all times. A
model armed with grenades can use them as many times as they wish.</p>
<p><em>HEAVY</em>: If carrying a weapon, armour or equipment with this
Keyword, the model cannot move/dash and shoot during its Activation, and
the model cannot roll D6 and add it to the Charge move. A model can only
carry one item with this Keyword.</p>
<p><em>HERETIC</em>: The model is a member of the Heretic Legion
faction.</p>
<p><em>INFILTRATOR</em>: Models with this Keyword can be deployed
anywhere on the table out of line of sight of any enemies, but at least
8” away from the closest</p>
<p>enemy. They are deployed after all other models without this Keyword.
If any infiltrators cannot be deployed according to these restrictions
then those models can always be placed in your deployment zone. If a
scenario does not allow for infiltrators, deploy models with this
Keyword during standard deployment as if they didn’t have this
Keyword.</p>
<p><em>NEW ANTIOCH</em>: This model is part of the New Antioch
faction.</p>
<p><em>PILGRIM</em>: This model is part of the Pilgrim faction.</p>
<p><em>LIMIT (X)</em>: You can only purchase as many of this piece of
equipment/weapon/armour as indicated by the number in parenthesis for
your warband. If you find more via looting/exploration, you can break
this limit.</p>
<p><em>RISKY ACTION</em>: If you fail your roll on the <strong>Action
Success Chart </strong>when taking this <em>ACTION</em>, the Activation
of this model ends immediately.</p>
<p><em>SHRAPNEL</em>: A model hit by a weapon with this Keyword suffers
a <em>BLOOD MARKER</em>, in addition to any other effects of the attack.
The model suffers this</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKER </em>even if the attack has no other effects or is
otherwise negated. Some equipment or abilities can negate the additional
<em>BLOOD MARKER </em>caused by this Keyword.</p>
<p><em>SKIRMISHER</em>: When a model with this Keyword is targeted by an
enemy’s Charge, it may immediately move D3” in any direction, except
into Melee Combat. A Skirmisher may also make this move when a charging
enemy model would enter Melee Combat with it during a Charge that is not
targeting it. After either of these moves is resolved, the Charge
continues as normal toward the original target. These moves can only be
taken if the Skirmisher is not in Melee Combat and only one such move
may be taken per Charge.</p>
<p><em>STRONG</em>: A model with this Keyword ignores the rules for
weapons/armour/equipment with Keyword <em>HEAVY</em>, including not
being limited to carrying only one <em>HEAVY </em>item (though other
limitations apply as normal). In addition, it may use a single
two-handed Melee weapon as a one-handed weapon.</p>
<p><em>SULTANATE</em>: This model is part of the Iron Sultanate
faction.</p>
<p><em>TOUGH</em>: If a <em>TOUGH </em>model would be taken Out Of
Action, it is knocked Down instead. After a <em>TOUGH </em>model has
been knocked Down in this way once, it can be taken Out of Action as
normal.</p>

<p>n this part of the book, we will take a detailed look at each warband
and provide the information you need to recruit one.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-faction"><u>Choose Your Faction</u></h3>
<p>Each warband in Trench Crusade belongs to a faction fighting in the
Great War. Use the faction lists that follow to recruit and equip your
warband. These lists provide information about the troop types
available, their weapons, armour and equipment options, as well as
special rules specific to that faction.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Most warbands have Variant Lists which you can
use instead of the main list. These are listed as part of the Warband
List entry and they detail how the variant differs from the core
list.</p>
<h3 id="recruit-your-warband"><u>Recruit Your Warband</u></h3>
<p>Once you have selected your faction (and possible Variant), you have
700 ducats to spend on your initial warband. Each model and their
equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs a set amount of money. As you
make your choices, subtract the money you have “spent” from your total
until you have bought all you can. Any unspent ducats are put into the
warband’s strongbox and can be used later or hoarded to buy something
more expensive.</p>
<p>Some items, weapons and armour cost Glory Points instead of ducats to
acquire them. Glory Points are earned by performing valorous deeds in
battle. Refer to the section on Glory for details. Generally
warbands</p>
<p>don’t have access to Glory Points when they are created, so these
purchases usually happen later on in the campaign.</p>
<p>Each warband list details what troops are available to you and in
what numbers. Most lists include a model they must have when the warband
is created, usually representing its commanding officer. Otherwise
you</p>
<p>are allowed to purchase as many or as few warriors as you wish. We
recommend that the weapons, armour and equipment you choose for your
warriors should be represented on the models themselves to make it
easier for you and your opponents to play the game.</p>
<h3 id="keywords-1"><u>Keywords</u></h3>
<p>Some troop types, weapons and pieces of equipment have Keywords that
give them special abilities, or denote them to be part of a group of
models where certain rules apply to all models with the same Keyword.
See the section on Keywords for details.</p>
<h6 id="limitations">Limitations</h6>
<p>Some armaments are more limited in supply. They may have the
following Keywords that limit their availability. These limitations are
shown in the warband lists as follows:</p>
<p>; <em>LIMIT </em><strong>(x)</strong>: If the piece of equipment has
a Keyword <em>LIMIT</em>, then your warband cannot have more than the
set number of this type of weapon, armour or equipment. For example, if
a Weapon has Keyword <em>LIMIT </em><strong>(2)</strong>, then your
warband can purchase a maximum of two such weapons. If you lose any of
these weapons during the campaign, you can buy replacements with
available funds up to a maximum of two.</p>
<p>; <em>ELITE </em><strong>only</strong>: Some weapons, armour or
equipment are only usable by troops with the <em>ELITE </em>Keyword. You
cannot give them to troops without the <em>ELITE </em>Keyword even if
you acquire extras during a campaign.</p>
<h3 id="equipment"><u>Equipment</u></h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in the rules, each warrior may carry the
following:</p>
<p>; One two-handed ranged weapon OR</p>
<p>; Up to two one-handed ranged weapons.</p>
<p>When it comes to making sure the models in your game match their
actual equipment and weapons, we recommend the following maxim:</p>
<p><strong>“Be strict with yourself but lenient with
others.”</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="2901154acd158e5b9a2787aa89e60ed8a7c1c750.png"

style="width:10.79375in;height:10.67708in" alt="image" /></strong></p>
<p>In addition, they may carry:</p>
<p>; One two-handed melee weapon OR</p>
<p>; Up to two single-handed melee weapons.</p>
<p>You may buy additional equipment between battles or acquire new
weapons during a campaign, and freely change the equipment, weapons and
armour of your fighters unless otherwise noted in their warband list</p>
<p>entry. You must still obey the limitations as explained in the rules
when it comes to changing the armaments of your models.</p>
<p>Some models come equipped with set weapons and armour when purchased,
whilst some models may not change their loadout at all. All these cases
are clearly indicated in the rules.</p>

<h3 id="allies-mercenaries"><u>Allies &amp; Mercenaries</u></h3>
<p>During the campaign you will have a chance to obtain <strong>Glory
Points </strong>which can be used to purchase powerful troops and famous
warriors known as Allies. These will add both numbers and specialist
abilities to your warband. They cannot be purchased with ducats – the
only way to attract their services is to perform glorious deeds on the
battlefield!</p>
<p>Allies fight alongside your warband, but they do not benefit or
suffer from any special rules or restrictions that your warband might
have. For example, a mercenary’s equipment never counts toward the
<em>LIMIT </em>for any of the items that they have. Additionally, a Sin
Eater (a mercenary available to the Heretic Legions) would not be
affected by the Trench Ghost’s unique rules such as Slow and Undead
Fortitude. If a rule is capable of affecting Allies, it will explicitly
state so.</p>
<h3 id="purchasable-abilities"><u>Purchasable Abilities</u></h3>
<p>Some warbands allow you to purchase optional abilities for your
models, such as the Goetic Powers of the Court of the Seven-headed
Serpent. Unless otherwise specified, you can only ever buy one copy of
any of these abilities for a single model. The same applies to bonuses
gained from equipment, such as Martyrdom pills.</p>
<h3 id="roster"><u>Roster</u></h3>
<p>You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details of your
warband. Blank roster sheets can be found printed at the back of this
book and we offer a free digital version of the roster sheet at
trenchcrusade.com.</p>
<p>When you choose a warband, take a warband roster sheet and write down
the details of each trooper in the appropriate place. It is a good idea
to work out the</p>
<p>warband on a piece of scrap paper first, as you will have to juggle
the weapons and fighters to get as close to the maximum permitted value
of the warband as possible.</p>
<p>If you have any cash left after choosing your warband write this down
in the space marked Strongbox. You will need to give your warband a name
as well as name all your Elites and all your common troopers. It’s up to
you to invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of inspiration

<p>A</p>
<p>shroud of darkness blankets the world. Smoke and brimstone spews from
the yawning gates of Inferno, enveloping the lands where people have
abandoned God and openly wage war against His Creation.</p>
<p>It is a grim reality that a full third of humanity has bent its knee
before the idols of Hell. The main military force of Satan on Earth is
the Heretic Legions, raised from amongst these citizens of the
damned.</p>
<p>Under special absolution from the Cardinal Protector, many spies have
been dispatched into Hell’s domains over the years. Most are caught,
never to be seen again, save for some whose eternally screaming heads
are returned to New Antioch, branded with bleeding runes that mock the
Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Against all odds some do make it back to the light, whispering of the
horrors they have witnessed: of firstborn cast into the mouths of the
burning statues of Baal and human flesh sold by the pound in dreadful
markets. They speak of the great idols of the Golden Calf and rapturous
men and women who prostrate themselves before them, carving off strips
of their own flesh in ecstatic offering. Inverted pyramids and
towers</p>
<p>descend into the depths of these cities, built of iron and black
stone. Within these pits stand sacrificial altars where weeping captives
are slowly sliced to death over agonising days and weeks with wicked
knives made of infernal basalt. Cathedrals dedicated to the Princes of
Hell hang from great arches of volcanic stone, while condemned are
crucified on hundreds of upside-down crosses.</p>
<p>Accounts speak of sprawling factories made of mutilated flesh and
metal, their forges yielding endless munitions for the ongoing war.
Guided by the teachings of Tartarus’ smiths, alchemists toil over
colossal weapons and armoured behemoths, wielding the forbidden secrets
of their patrons’ metallurgy to forge instruments of death and suffering
beyond the grasp of any human engineer. These are once-proud cities of
Earth, where churches have been toppled and entire populations are now
dedicated towards bringing down the very Throne</p>
<p>of Heaven.</p>
<p>Amongst the forsaken citizens enduring within Hell’s earthly domains,
the greatest status is afforded to those who fight in the Great War.
Most do this as Heretic Troopers who serve their liege lords in lieu of
tribute. To join the army of damnation as a full-fledged Legionnaire is
no easy feat. Those who wish to win a place amongst the Heretic Legions
must make an unholy pilgrimage</p>
<p>to the burning bronze gates of Hell where the infernal heat, felt
from leagues away, sears both flesh and spirit until the torment becomes
unbearable. Along the Valley of Tears, the great road that leads to the
gate is paved with wailing souls and lamentations and littered with
endless mounds of charred bodies. Many are still half- alive, writhing
in agony, trapped in a grotesque twilight between life and death, their
wickedness deemed insufficient. These discarded souls are doomed to
suffer until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p>Those who make it within sight of Hell’s Maw are considered worthy
and are initiated into the Legions, taking unbreakable vows that chain
them into darkness for all eternity, their bodies branded with the mark
of the Devil Lord that has claimed them. Armouries of Hell equip them
for battle and Heretic Priests beckon forth new supplicants as dictated
by the whispers of their patron Archdevils. Thus a new Heretic
Legionnaire is born. They hail Archdevils as their masters and are thus
damned for all eternity.</p>
<p>There are some who push further on, to the Gate itself and beyond.
Their very flesh ignites, never to recover, but those with the blackest
souls can enter Inferno</p>
<p>itself. Amongst those the Anointed are especially revered amongst the
Legions. They are the paragons of unhinged brutality – men and women of
colossal vigour and unyielding devotion. Having tread the accursed path
to the shores of the Lake of Eternal Flame, where the damned wither and
contort in ceaseless torment, the Anointed emerge forever scarred by the
embrace</p>
<p>of abyssal fires. The blackened and burnt flesh of the Anointed will
never heal, but in exchange they are granted the right to wear Heavy
Gehenna armoured</p>
<p><em>“We are no longer supplicating weaklings trembling before an
unmerciful God. We say: Blessed are the mighty-minded, for they shall
ride the whirlwinds.”</em></p>
<p>- Ramman, Anointed of the XXI Heretic Legion ‘Widowmakers’</p>
<p>suits and they gain strength to wield weapons that a normal man could
barely lift. It is said that to gaze into their eyes is to glimpse the
flames of Hell, forever etched in their vision.</p>
<p>Yet some who witness go even further in their depraved devotion.
Suicide is a mortal sin and one eagerly embraced by many. Most cry out
for devils to notice their final sacrifice in vain, as the Infernal
nobles are capricious and delight in betraying their own as much as
their enemies. But those with truly wicked and depraved souls are
resurrected in contempt of the</p>
<p>Redeemer, coming back as Choristers, horrific mockeries of Creation
whose severed heads sing unholy hymns praising the Devil, their voices
causing the ears of their enemies to bleed.</p>
<p>Though the vast bulk of the Heretic Legions are made of mortal
humans, Hell often sends their own abhorrent progeny to reinforce their
mortal foot soldiers: nightmarish War Beasts made of captured and
possessed creatures and dreaded Artillery Witches who act as mobile
artillery supporting lighting assaults. Thus, in this accursed theatre
of war, mortals and abominations march hand in withering hand, bound by
the suffering ties of damnation. The wails of tortured beasts meld with
the shrieks of damned souls, while the skies rain down fiery retribution
upon all who dare to oppose the Heretics’ ceaseless crusade for a
demented parity with their Creator.</p>

<p><em>Terrifying blades blessed by the hand of a greater devil, these
knives are used in Heretic rituals to sacrifice captives to the dark

indescribable pain and even the slightest wound often proves fatal. They

Action with either of the Claws you may immediately move the model up to
6” in any direction. If the move takes you into contact with another
enemy model, this counts as a charge and you can make a second Melee
Attack <em>ACTION </em>with both claws. You can only do this follow-up
move once per Activation.</p>

<p>0-1 Heretic Chorister <strong>(Cost: 65 Ducats)</strong></p>
<p><em>Suicide is a Mortal Sin, and sacrificing yourself to the glory of
Hell is a yet greater affront to God. Some Heretics born with a gift of
sonorous voice but little prospects of rising through the ranks but
possessing a determination to excel may pursue the dark path of becoming
a Chorister.</em></p>
<p><em>Such supplicants go to one of the black altars of Heretic abodes
at the bottom of the deep inverted pyramid temples dedicated to the
greatest of Arch-devils. There they are dressed in the robes of dark
devotion, lie on the altar and mutilate themselves to death by carving
unholy runes into their flesh. The more wounds they can suffer before
perishing, the more pleasing it is said their offering is. The most
devout slice their own throats, trying to cut as deep as they can before
their miserable life leaves them.</em></p>
<p><em>Most such wretches go to their doom in the Lake of Fire, but some
are reborn as Choristers after nine days. Their corpses lurch back to
their feet, and finish their grisly beheading, and lift their severed
heads that begin to sing hymns they have learned in the Inferno. From
their self-inflicted wounds spurts cold blood that forms diabolic
symbols and changes to match the words of their unholy chorale. They
head towards the front lines driven by a call no living can hear and
join the Heretic warband of their choosing.</em></p>
<p><em>As their severed heads sing their agonising hymns, the minds of
their enemies are filled with visions from the Pits of Hell, weakening
both the resolve and strength of those unfortunate enough to hear the
dire song of a Chorister. Their hymns are often the first thing a fresh
recruit experiences on the battlefield, as their unholy voice rolls
across the trenches, proclaiming a never-ending prophecy of the final
victory of Hell over Heaven.</em></p>

<p>You cannot buy additional equipment, weapons or armour for War
Wolves. Each War Wolf is encased in a nigh impregnable suit of Tartarus
Armour that is reflected in its profile above. Additionally, each War
Wolf has a set of Shredding Claws and a vicious Chainsaw Mouth. These
pieces of equipment are built into the integrity of its construction and
cannot be removed or lost in any way. The weapons are detailed below.
The War Wolf may make one attack <em>ACTION </em>with each of these
weapons in Melee Combat and may make no other attacks during its
Activation (so it can make two attacks per Activation).</p>
<p>; <strong>Chainmaw</strong>: The War Wolf treats its Chainsaw Mouth
as a melee weapon with the Keyword <em>RISKY </em>that grants a <em>+1
DICE </em>bonus to hit (for total of +3D).</p>
<p>Additionally, the attack ignores any armour worn by the target and
has a <em>+1 DICE</em></p>
<p>bonus to injure. The Chainsaw Mouth does not take any hands to
wield.</p>
<p>; <strong>Shredding Claws</strong>: The War Wolf treats its Shredding
Claws as a two-handed</p>
<p>melee weapon with the Keywords <em>RISKY </em>and
<em>CUMBERSOME</em>. The Shredding Claws have a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus
to injure. Because the Shredding Claws are wielded alongside the
Chainsaw Mouth, they are treated as an Off-Hand Weapon and suffer
penalties accordingly.</p>

<p>An Artillery Witch is always equipped with an endless supply of

Otherwise, she can be equipped with any melee weapon, armour or
equipment from the Heretic Legion Armoury.</p>
<p class="heading" id="abilities-7">Abilities</p>
<p>; <strong>Infernal Bomb</strong>: This wicked infernal weapon is
treated as a one-handed Ranged weapon with the Keyword <em>BLAST
3</em>”. Specify a 1x1mm point on the battlefield within 36” that the
Witch can see and that you want to target. Next, make a Ranged Attack
<em>ACTION</em>. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less with the two
lowest Dice), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location,
multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for
example, if you rolled 5, the bomb lands 2” away, as 7 - 5 = 2). The
direction is decided by your opponent. Roll on the Injury Chart for each
model within the <em>BLAST </em>radius.</p>
<p>If the bomb lands exactly on top of any model, roll with 3D6 on the
Injury Chart and add the dice together! Other models hit by the bomb
roll on the Injury Chart as standard. Any model hit, but not taken Out
of Action, by this attack is blown D3” directly away from the point of
impact (roll for each model separately), stopping if they hit other
models, buildings or objects. This attack has the Keyword <em>SHRAPNEL
</em>and therefore causes an additional +1 <em>BLOOD MARKER</em>. Cover,
range and higher position do not affect attacks by the Infernal Bomb.
Roll injuries for models that would benefit from Cover from the
perspective of the <em>BLAST </em>point with <em>-1 DICE</em>. The
Activation of the Witch ends immediately after using the Infernal
Bomb.</p>
<p>; <strong>Artificial Life</strong>: Artillery Witches are not
affected by <em>FEAR</em>. Additionally, attacks with the Keyword
<em>GAS </em>suffer a <em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to injure the Witch and
they do not suffer additional <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>from the Keyword
<em>GAS</em>.</p>

<p><em>Many unfortunates fall into the hands of the Heretic warbands,

<p><em>Their lot is grim and terrible. They are worked to death in the

Thus it is no wonder that many Heretic warbands drive swarms of the
Wretched ahead of them to blunt and slow down the enemy

Heretic Naval Raiding Party</u></h3>
<p>The Heretic Fleet operates as a semi-autonomous entity under the
command of its High Captain and other admirals. The Heretics have their
own marine infantry that often operates in small bands, striking deep
behind enemy lines and executing smash and grab missions.</p>
<p>They are always on the lookout for captives, loot, information,
supplies, rare artefacts and any opportunity to express their cruelty
and brutality. They are picked from amongst the best soldiers of the
Heretic Legions, and have access to equipment and weapons gained from
past battles and terrible atrocities they have committed.</p>
<h6 id="special-rules">Special rules</h6>
<p>The Heretic Naval Raiding Party has the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Fast as Lightning: </strong>All Models have <em>+1
DICE</em></p>
<p>when taking their Dash <em>ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Close Assault Weapons: </strong>The warband can buy</p>
<p>Submachine Guns for 25 ducats per weapon.</p>
<p>; <strong>Light Troops: </strong>The force may only include 0-1</p>
<p>Annointed and 0-1 Artillery Witch.</p>

<p>include a War Wolf.</p>
<p>; <strong>Unseen Advance: </strong>Up to three models</p>

<p><em>INFILTRATORS </em>at the cost of 10 ducats per Model.</p>
<h3 id="warband-variant"><u>Warband Variant:</u></h3>
<p><u>Trench Ghosts</u></p>
<p>Sometimes when Heretic troopers die upon a hallowed ground or in
presence of an uncorrupted holy relic, they become trapped between
planes of existence. Claimed by neither Heaven nor Hell, the Trench
Ghosts become Undead – doomed to fight a war without an end, attacking
both the Faithful and Heretic alike, hating all life, obeying commands
that no living can hear. Their greed for worldly wealth and items of
power remains undiminished, and their semi-corporeal bodies are
exceedingly difficult to destroy. Their faces, covered with gas masks
they no longer have any use for, betray nothing of the agony they
endure. In close combat they whisper of the agony of their existence and
the pain of their doom which will never give them rest, their broken
bodies and shattered minds forced to endure the horrors of war for all
eternity. Few can withstand such terror without breaking.</p>
<p>Tales are told of many Trench Ghost Warbands that haunt No Man’s
Land, but the most famous are the Ghosts of Tannenberg, shades of the
Heretic force that won the battle of Tannenberg but after sacking the
Church of St. Jacob passed into the shadow.</p>
<h6 id="special-rules-1">Special rules</h6>
<p>The Trench Ghosts have the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Horror: </strong>All models in the Warband cause
<em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Semi-corporeal: </strong>Any attacks against all models</p>
<p>in the Trench Ghost warband roll injuries with <em>-1</em></p>
<p><em>DICE </em>– the undead are hard to kill!</p>
<p>; <strong>Spectral: </strong>All models in the warband ignore</p>
<p>movement penalties caused by Difficult Terrain, though they cannot
move through any objects/</p>
<p>terrain. Dangerous terrain affects them as normal.</p>
<p>; <strong>Undead: </strong>All models in the Trench Ghost</p>
<p>warband do not suffer additional <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em></p>
<p>from attacks with the Keyword <em>GAS</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Enemies of All</strong>: Trench Ghosts cannot use</p>
<p>Mercenaries.</p>
<p>; <strong>Battlefield Looters</strong>: When this warband is</p>
<p>created, select one item with <em>LIMIT </em>in the Heretic Legions
Armoury. Its <em>LIMIT </em>is increased by one for</p>
<p>your warband.</p>
<p>; <strong>Lost Souls: </strong>Since only mortals who have souls</p>
<p>become ghosts, this warband may not have any model with the Keyword
<em>ARTIFICIAL</em>, such as War Wolves or Artillery Witches. In
addition, no model in the warband may have a Hellbound Soul Contract or
an Infernal Brand Mark. Any model that has one of these pieces of
equipment in their base profile will not have it, although its price
stays the same.</p>

<p>; <strong>Slow: </strong>All models in Trench Ghost warband have a
half Dash distance (i.e. 3”).</p>
<p>; <strong>Sarcophagus Mine</strong>: At the cost of +35</p>
<p>ducats, up to two of the Troopers can be turned into Sarcophagus
Mines. They gain an armour characteristic of -3, but can carry no other
weapons or any other items from the Armoury. In addition, whenever an
enemy comes within 3” of the Mine, you can trigger a detonation as
described below.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can forgo this and explode the mine during your
own Activation of the model with a successful <em>RISKY ACTION </em>with
<em>+1 DICE</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever an enemy comes within 3” of the Mine, you can
trigger a detonation as described below. Alternatively, you can forgo
this and explode the mine during your own Activation of the model with a
successful RISKY ACTION with +1 DICE.</p>
<p>; When detonated, the mine explosion</p>
<p>is treated as a <em>BLAST 3</em><strong>” </strong>weapon targeting
the Sarcophagus model with Keyword <em>SHRAPNEL</em>. Models within 1”
of the model hit by the explosion roll their injuries with
<em>+1</em></p>
<p><em>DICE</em>. The Mine itself is taken Out of Action.</p>
<p>; <strong>Barbed Wire Banshee</strong>: Instead of a Chorister,</p>
<p>a Trench Ghost warband may include a Barbed Wire Banshee at the same
cost. It has the same characteristics as a Chorister with the usual
Trench Ghost special rules applied to it, but instead of the Unholy
Hymns ability the Banshee has Death Wail</p>
<p>as detailed below:</p>
<p>; Death Wail: All enemy models within 8”</p>
<p>of the Chorister suffer an additional <em>+1 DICE</em></p>
<p>when any injury roll is made against them.</p>
<p>; <strong>Tank Palanquin</strong>: At the cost of 55 ducats, the</p>
<p>Heretic Priest of the warband can ride a ghostly Tank Palanquin. This
counts as Machine Armour and the Priest riding it has a 50mm base, and
counts as being on a 2” high platform. While on a Tank Palanquin, the
Priest gains the Keyword <em>STRONG</em>.</p>
<p>Warband Variant:</p>
<p><u>Knights of Avarice</u></p>
<p>The warbands who follow the Prince of Greed call themselves the
Knights of Avarice. Such heretics display their wealth extravagantly and
prefer to carry the most expensive and hard-to-acquire weapons, armour
and equipment, suffering none to join them who lacks</p>
<p>the means to obtain their glittering panoply. They are festooned with
chains of gold and the finest silk cloaks, their armour is gilded with
gold and decorated with precious stones, and the handles of their great
coin hammers are made of the rarest of wood. Yet despite the opulent
wealth at display, their finery is tarnished by the blood and soot that
spews from the Hellgate, and the delicate artistic filigree of their
golden masks is both terrible and beautiful in equal measure. In
combat</p>
<p>they favour hammers and clubs that break the bones but leave the
flesh and blood intact, as well as poison gas and highly accurate
rifles. They scorn crude and destructive fire or explosive weapons that
could damage any objects of value.</p>
<p>After the Knights of Avarice have claimed victory in combat, they
scour the battlefield or any settlement they’ve conquered like a swarm
of locusts. Anything and everything of value is taken: metals from brass
to bronze, silver to gold, art objects, precious stones, livestock,
trade goods, rare tomes and scrolls… all are meticulously catalogued and
carried away by slaves and demonic beasts of burden or great armoured
cars that take the stolen loot to the underground treasure chambers</p>
<p>which act as the temples of Mammon. Even the dead are stripped of
their flesh with the detached skill of seasoned butchers, ready to be
sold at market. Internal organs taken from fallen victims are carefully
preserved in alchemical liquids to be sold to the scientists of the
infernal laboratories.</p>
<p>For the Heretics of the Path of Mammon hoarding riches is not mere
acquisition of wealth – it is their religious compulsion. Ironically,
they gain little pleasure from their vast wealth, as their greed makes
them continuously desire ever greater riches. Thus their warbands
forever roam No Man’s Land, looking for forgotten treasures or foes to
dissect and turn into wealth. For the greed of Mammon will never be
sated.</p>
<h6 id="special-rules-2">Special rules</h6>
<p>The Knights of Avarice have the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Worship Mammon: </strong>In a campaign, the patron of the
warband will always be Mammon. Instead of the Puppet Master ability, the
Heretic Priest of the Knights of Avarice may select the Price of Greed
ability if they wish:</p>
<p><em><strong>The</strong> <strong>Price</strong> <strong>of</strong>
<strong>Greed</strong></em>: Worldly wealth belonging to the target
model of this curse starts crushing them under its weight. Choose any
model the Priest sees within 12” and take a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. If
successful, roll immediately on the Injury Chart for that model and add
<em>+1 DICE </em>to the injury roll for each -1 Armour modifier the
model has (for example if the model has a Trench Shield and standard
armour, add <em>+2 DICE </em>to the injury rolls).</p>
<p>; <strong>Mammon’s Chosen: </strong>Knights of Avarice allow only the
wealthiest and the best-equipped</p>
<p>candidates to join their ranks. Your force may have no models that
cost less than 80 ducats (including</p>
<p>their equipment).</p>
<p>; <strong>Corrupt Merchants: </strong>Many merchants, traders</p>
<p>and moneylenders within the Faithful nations are followers of Mammon
and secretly supply the</p>
<p>Knights of Avarice with their wares. When creating the warband,
select one weapon, suit of armour or other piece of equipment from the
New Antioch Armoury and one such item from the Iron Sultanate Armoury.
You can acquire this gear exactly as</p>
<p>the warband they come from. Any of these items in question must not
be already available to the Heretic Warband. All the same limitations of
the</p>
<p>original lists apply, so there is little point in taking an
Assassin’s Dagger (for example) since it can be only used by Assassins.
These two selected additions are</p>
<p>available to your warband throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>; <strong>Preserve the Loot: </strong>Knights of Avarice greatly</p>
<p>dislike using weapons that could damage the amount of wealth that can
be extracted from the fallen. No weapon with the Keyword <em>FIRE
</em>or <em>SHRAPNEL </em>can be used by any model in this warband. In
addition, the Artillery Witches of this warband use Gas Bombs: They have
the Keyword <em>GAS </em>instead of <em>SHRAPNEL </em>and they ignore
armour. Injuries caused by a direct hit are rolled with 2D6 and models
within a 3” blast radius are rolled with <em>-1 DICE</em>.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, their Grenade Launchers have the</p>
<p><em>GAS </em>keyword instead of the <em>SHRAPNEL </em>keyword, have a
-1 D to injury rolls and ignore armour.</p>
<p>; <strong>Infernal Rivalry: </strong>Mammon is a rival of Beruth,</p>
<p>the great devil of wrath and murder, who is the</p>
<p>Patron of Death Commandos. Knights of Avarice may include no Death
Commandos.</p>
<p>; <strong>Goetic Warlocks: </strong>Goetic Warlocks are creations</p>
<p>of Mammon. This warband may include one for the price of 110 ducats.
This Warlock is still a mercenary and obeys all of the rules associated
with being a mercenary (such as having fixed equipment and not being
able to be promoted to an <em>ELITE </em>throughout</p>
<p>the course of a campaign).</p>
<p>; <strong>Debtors to Mammon</strong>: Wretched of the warband</p>
<p>are not tied by Mammon’s Chosen rule.</p>

often with a beautiful, cherub-like face warped or corrupted in some
way, such as with inhuman eyes or with the whole face twisted
upside-down. Despite its splendour the armour is always tarnished by
blood, offal or other kind of corruption. Merely seeing it fills mortals
with incredible greed and makes the wearer an immediate target of their
wrath as they attempt to tear it from them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The suit counts as Reinforced Armour, a
helmet and a gas mask. When an enemy declares a charge, they must charge
the model wearing this armour if it is visible, not in cover and within
12” of the wearer. The charging model must be able to reach this model
without climbing, leaping or crossing dangerous terrain. If the wearer
of the armour is already in melee combat, this power has no effect.

25 ducats</p>
<p><em>Battle Standards of Mammon are opulently decorated works of art,
icons and banners done in mockery of the virtues of Charity and
Temperance. Always made of the most expensive materials, each is a
unique work of dark genius, often depicting saints performing vile sins

the Prince of Greed.</em></p>

as long as the model with the Flag is not Down or Out of Action.
Requires one hand to use as if it was a weapon, both in ranged and melee

<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The area within 3” of the altar is Difficult
Terrain for all models in the opposing Warband. This affects even models
that can Fly. The model carrying the altar may drop it at any point

<p>A</p>
<p>s the war rages against the minions of Hell, strange visions torment
the faithful across the globe. Men and women touched by Heaven are
granted visions and Revelations are made by the messengers of</p>
<p>God. Sisters of the Holy Orders are marked by Stigmata and take up
the sword and the cross as instructed by angels. Those who have
transgressed seek to atone for their sins by taking as many followers of
the Devil with them to the afterlife.</p>
<p>So they come, the mad and the maimed, the God- touched and the
guilt-ridden – all gathering around Prophets and Prophetesses, forming
Trench Pilgrim Processions. These disorganised groups arm themselves and
follow the prophets of the Lord unto the front lines. They fight with
unrivalled zeal, hurling themselves against the Heretics, arming
themselves with anything they can get their hands on from the oldest
muskets to scourges and Molotov Cocktails.</p>
<p>Pilgrims are not officially sanctioned by the Holy See of New
Antioch, but the Church still blesses the crusades of the faithful. Thus
the Pilgrim Processions are a common sight on the battlefields, often
crossing No Man’s Land in suicidal assaults upon the</p>
<p>Heretics, directed by the visions of their Prophets and Prophetesses
who lead them, urged on by the whips of Castigators who are charged with
instilling the Fear of God in their troops.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Pilgrims are men and women with little military
training, but when they don the Iron Capirote of a Trench Pilgrim, they
can face even a demon from the deepest Bolgias of Hell unflinchingly.
Nor is death necessarily an end to their mission: sometimes the Seventh
Meta-Christ will deem a</p>
<p>fallen pilgrim worthy and bring them back as Martyr- Penitents:
warriors half-way between Heaven and Earth, able to fight once more and
feel no pain from bullet or bayonet thrust.</p>
<p>Rarer and more dangerous are the Stigmatic Nuns, Holy Sisters who
manifest wounds to match those of the Third Meta-Christ whom they
venerate. They excel in</p>
<p>close quarter combat, for each bleeding wound that they suffer makes
them stronger, not weaker, as their devotion to suffering as their Lord
once did gives them strength and endurance not found in common mortals.
Armed with swords and pistols, they cross No Man’s Land heedless of any
danger, praying to sustain wounds for the Redeemer which in turn will
transform them into the very Vengeance of the Lord.</p>
<p>In front of the Trench Pilgrims are driven the Ecclesiastic Prisoners
– either captured enemies of the True Faith or volunteer sinners. Each
is strapped with a high explosive which is detonated once they reach
enemy lines. They dash across the killing grounds, hoping to somehow
survive the blast and escape, or take as many followers of Lucifer with
them as they can, depending on their convictions.</p>
<p>The most puissant of Pilgrim Processions will be accompanied by a
Shrine Anchorite, a metal behemoth some twelve feet tall, a living altar
of war almost completely immune to any damage. The interior of the
Anchorite is covered in spikes and barbed hooks so that the monk pilot
is in a constant state of torment, rejoicing in their pain so they can
suffer as their Lord once did.</p>
<p>In combat they wield Adamantine Catherine Wheels of massive
proportions which they use to crush sinners and heretics into a pulp,
stringing them upon the wheel as a warning to others.</p>
<p>There are a bewildering number and variety of Trench Pilgrim
Processions: The Path of Pious Revenge swears in the name of St. Olga
and uses flamethrowers, burning grenades and incendiary ammunition to
assail the Heretics. The Pilgrims of the Iron Path follow St. Rita of
Cascia and go to battle with hammers, mauls, maces and cudgels, and
hammer nails into their heads in the memory of the saint they venerate.
The Theban Legion of Rome carries the heads of the heretics upon their
standards in the memory of their patron, St. Marice.</p>
<p>They fight with swords and other blades, competing with each other
for the number of heretic heads they amass.</p>
<p>Trench Pilgrims of the Procession of the Sacred Affliction are known
for their zeal in close quarter</p>
<p><em>“A wicked and adulterous genera- tion seeketh after a sign; and
no sign shall be given unto it, but the sign of the
meta-christ.”</em></p>

Prisoners fight unarmed in melee, flailing feebly with their manacled
arms. The -1D penalty to melee combat is already included in the profile

Martyrdom Device can trigger it at any point during their Activation.
This does not require an <em>ACTION</em>. When detonated, the explosion
is treated as a <em>BLAST </em>3” weapon targeting the prisoner model.
Models within 1” of the prisoner hit by the explosion roll their
injuries with</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE</em>. The prisoner rolls 4d6 and adds them together to
determine the results of their injury roll. If the explosive goes off
and the prisoner somehow survives the battle, you can buy them a new
explosive for 35 ducats as normal, or simply field them without.</p>

<p><em>A colossal suit of machine armour fuelled by diesel and faith,
the Shrine Anchorite stands as a grim symbol of humanity’s despair.
Within its spiked, blood-stained interior, the pilot- monk endures a
terrible form of penance, his anguished prayers and chants echoing
across the battlefield. This grotesque amalgamation of suffering and
devotion instils fear in the heart of the heretic, as the anchorite, a
malevolent weapon draped in holy iconography and weeping gore, emerges
to unleash a symphony of slaughter, where the wretched union of man and

<p class="heading" id="equipment-17">Equipment</p>
<p>You cannot buy additional equipment, weapons or armour for Anchorite
Shrines. Each Anchorite Shrine is equipped with a special suit of armour
(reflected in the profile), a Combat Helmet, a Catherine Wheel and a
Bonebreaker Mace. These pieces of equipment are built into the integrity
of its construction and cannot be removed or lost in any way. The
weapons are detailed below. The Anchorite may make one attack <em>ACTION
</em>with each of these weapons in Melee Combat and may make no other
attacks during its Activation (so it can make two attacks per
Activation).</p>
<p>; <strong>Catherine Wheel</strong>: The Anchorite Shrine treats the
Catherine Wheel as a one-handed melee weapon with the Keywords <em>RISKY
</em>and <em>HEAVY </em>that grants a</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to hit (for a total of <em>+3 DICE </em>due to
its Melee Characteristic). Because of the enormous weight and the skill
of the Anchorite Shrine in inflicting maximum pain, the Catherine Wheel
rolls on the Injury Chart with 3D6 (instead</p>
<p>of usual 2D6), adding all three dice together!</p>
<p>; <strong>Bonebreaker Mace</strong>: The Anchorite Shrine treats the
Bonebreaker Mace as a</p>
<p>one-handed melee weapon with the Keyword <em>RISKY</em>. The
Bonebreaker Mace has a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to injure. Because the
Mace is wielded alongside the Catherine Wheel, it is treated as an
Off-Hand Weapon and suffers penalties accordingly.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastic Prisoner may voluntarily be broken on the wheel to show
their piety and devotion (permanently remove all weapons, armour and

Shrine will then shatter the bones of the volunteer and carry the broken
victim to the battle on its Wheel. As long as the volunteer is not taken
Out of Action, any Attacks against the Anchorite are redirected to the
volunteer. The volunteer cannot be independently targeted</p>
<p>by any abilities or attacks (including <em>BLAST </em>weapons). For
all rules purposes and attack effects (such as forced movement), the two
models are treated as a single model, including sharing <em>BLOOD</em>,
<em>INFECTION </em>and <em>BLESSING MARKERS</em>. Treat Down results
against the volunteer as a Minor Hit. The volunteer cannot take any

<p>Trench Pilgrims of the Procession of the Sacred Affliction are known
for their zeal in close quarter combat, their armour decorated with
icons and shields adorned with the depictions of the Saints, which
despite appearances can withstand machine gun bullets. The millstones
they carry upon their backs are used to tie about the necks of sinners
before drowning them in the mud and blood of No Man’s Land. They spurn
the use of the Iron Capirotes, believing firmly that faith alone is
enough to withstand the horrors of Hell.</p>
<h6 id="special-rules-3">Special Rules</h6>
<p>; <strong>Face thy Fears</strong>: No model in the Procession of the
Sacred Affliction can wear Iron Capirotes. Those troops with Capirotes

<p>; <strong>Reliquary Armoury</strong>: All models of this warband</p>
<p>(save for the Anchorite) can buy Holy Icon Shields for 20 ducats, not
just <em>ELITE </em>models. In addition, warband models with the
<em>ELITE </em>Keyword may</p>
<p>acquire Holy Icon Armour (see below).</p>
<p>; <strong>Punishing Millstones</strong>: All models in the</p>

<p>Castigator in this warband can be gripped by the vengeful fury of the
Lord. This model is immune to <em>FEAR </em>and disregards any <em>BLOOD
MARKERS </em>from any source. This model may never wear armour, though
they can carry a Trench Shield or Holy Icon Shield. Add +15 ducats to
the cost of this model. This model may not carry any ranged weapons.</p>
<h6 id="procession-special-equipment">Procession Special Equipment</h6>
<p><strong>Holy Icon Armour 30 ducats </strong>This suit of armour is
made of blessed icons and scripture scrolls written with the blood of

<h3 id="warband-variant-cavalcade-of-the-tenth-plague"><u>Warband
Variant: Cavalcade of the Tenth Plague</u></h3>
<p>This Trench Pilgrim Procession traditionally sacrifices lambs before
battle, anointing themselves in its blood to ward off the wrath of God.
The Pilgrims then draw holy symbols with the blood of the sacrifice upon
their bodies, clothing and armour, and then march to battle singing
hymns, in certain belief that the blood of the Lamb shields them from
any harm.</p>
<p>Firm believers in traditional reading of the Holy Texts, they reject
the new doctrines of the Meta-Christ by the Church. They steal
Communicants from other</p>
<p>Processions and force them to fight for them in penance for being
born from Sin.</p>
<h6 id="special-rules-4">Special Rules</h6>
<p>; <strong>Blood Sacrifice</strong>: Any model (except Ecclesiastic
Prisoners who are not worthy) in the warband can purchase a Sacrificial
Lamb (see below).</p>
<p>; <strong>Heaven Awaits</strong>: The Cavalcade rejects the</p>
<p>doctrine of the Meta-Christ. Their dead Pilgrims</p>
<p>cannot be resurrected as Martyr-Penitents.</p>
<p>; <strong>The Unclean</strong>: The Cavalcade detests using the</p>
<p>unclean Ecclesiastic Prisoners and may have only up</p>
<p>to two of them.</p>
<p>; <strong>Day of his Wrath</strong>: The War Prophet of this</p>
<p>warband cannot use <em>Laying on Hands </em>but can call upon the
Wrath of God instead. This is a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. If successful,
roll on the Injury Chart against one enemy model within 3” of the
Prophet.</p>
<p>Armour offers no protection against this attack.</p>
<p>; <strong>Stolen Communicants: </strong>Communicants cost</p>
<p>3 Glory Points instead of ducats for this warband due to the
difficulty of acquiring and indoctrinating</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>; <strong>Favour of the Lord</strong>: At the start of each turn,</p>
<p>you can give any one model in the warband a</p>

<h3 id="warband-variant-war-pilgrimage-of-saint-methodius"><u>Warband
Variant: War Pilgrimage of Saint Methodius</u></h3>
<p>From the Night of Fire and Blood that laid low the Greater Moravian
monastery of Velehrad emerged a single monk of the Orthodox Order of St.
Methodius. Though the rest of the brotherhood perished in the
catastrophe, slaughtered by a squadron of ruthless Death Commandos, the
sole survivor brought with him the books of the Saint and his faith out
of the ruin.</p>
<p>With the loss of the workshops and monastic libraries of Velehrad, it
was believed that the secrets of the Anchorite construction were lost,
especially since the Church no longer wished to pursue their
construction due to advances in armour technology elsewhere. But this
was in error. The monk, named brother Akakios, still knew the craft.</p>
<p>Akakios fled to the Theocratia of Hellas and founded a new monastery
on the slopes of holy Mount Athos. Many monks lived in the monastic
communities on the slopes of the mountain and some were attracted to
join their brother. Thus Akakios became the first War Prophet of the
Order and many lay members joined or became supporters and, eventually,
the foot soldiers of the well-equipped and disciplined War Pilgrimages
of</p>
<p>St. Methodius. No other Pilgrim Progression can match the methodical
and technical approach of the soldiers of the Order.</p>
<p>In their fortified monastery the learned monks hoard and protect the
knowledge of modifying the sacred designs of St. Methodius. Their Shrine
Anchorites are without a peer and feature many modern weapons and
adjustments which allow them to carry modern long- range weaponry. No
other warband has such abundant access to Anchorites or the variety of
sophisticated weaponry and equipment.</p>
<p>Following the ancient Orthodox creed, the pilgrims of St. Methodius
reject many of the teachings and</p>
<p>customs of other Pilgrim Processions. They consider the creation of
the Communicants as a dangerous heresy and condemn the use of Martyrdom
Devices as an affront to God’s commandment against suicide, as well as
holding to other beliefs many of the Trench Pilgrims view as</p>
<p>an essential part of their crusade against the forces of Inferno.
Bitter schisms and arguments with other sects sometimes erupt into
violence, and the Church itself accuses the Order of Hetrodoxy of
clinging to the outdated Eastern Orthodox faith.</p>
<p>However, due to their formidable fortress monasteries upon Mount
Athos and their undeniable zeal on the</p>
<p>battlefield, the Princes of the Church turn a blind eye to the
affairs of the followers of St. Methodius, as long as they focus all
their zeal in the seemingly impossible task of relieving the city of
Trebizond. Here, according to the visions of prophet Akakios, the
unsullied faith is still</p>
<p>practiced and the Salvation of Mankind will be achieved. To this end,
the Order sends one War Pilgrimage after another to the front line. Not
one has made it within sight of the fabled walls of Trebizond, but this
only increases the zeal of the Order and rouses them into ever greater
efforts to reach the City of the Hill.</p>

<p>W</p>
<p>hen the Infidels opened the thrice- cursed Gate to Jahannam,
releasing Gog and Magog upon those who believe, it seemed that all was
lost and Shaytan would emerge victorious over</p>
<p>Dunya. But the Creator of the Universe came to the aid of the
Faithful, and as had been written, the great Iron Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn
manifested itself in the lands ruled by the Sultan of Rûm. A call was
sent to those who believe righteously and, over the coming decades, the
migration of the Faithful took place across Europa, Asia and Africa.
Millions perished on the road and at sea, for the Heretics and their
Shaytan lords swarmed them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame,
devouring them and building vile monuments from their limbs and heads,
so they could not be buried as is decreed</p>
<p>in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the journey had
come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn were closed and the Great Sultanate
of the Invincible Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was
formed.</p>
<p>The assaults of the slaves of Jahannam against the Sultanate have
never ceased since that day, and each day new martyrs are mourned as
they defend the Wall and confront the heretics who have overcome its
defences. But within the walls, the lost knowledge flourishes and from
mosques of white marble and gold the muezzin call the faithful to pray
for the success of the Sultan’s army as it struggles to protect their
lands and defend the caravan trails that provide the Sultanate with
vital trade goods.</p>
<p>The Iron Wall is the greatest defensive work in the world, a mighty
bulwark festooned with the famed artillery of the Sultan. Azeb
sharpshooters stand at ready, ever watchful for surprise attacks, and
the elite Janissary regiments have barracks at set intervals near the
wall so they can react to any attack at speed. During a more serious
incursion a full muster of Azebs is called, the House of Wisdom
unleashes its terrifying <em>takwin </em>creations upon the foe, and if
the need is desperate, the Sultan himself comes forth and his</p>
<p>Janissaries march with him to do battle, carrying their green flag
before them.</p>
<p>Thus the protection of the Iron Wall has had an extensive influence
on the Sultanate Way of war. The conscripted Azebs are experts at
feigned flight and skirmish, while the loping Lions of Jabir harass the
enemy’s flanks. All the while the superb artillery of the Sultan
bombards the enemy as they make their tortuous journey across the
battlefield littered with traps set by skilled Sappers. When they reach
the ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite household
troops, close in and finish the enemy with their devastating
counter-charge led by their iron- willed officers. Dreaded Assassins
from Alamut prowl in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites
and</p>
<p>leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom unleash
devastating weapons made deadly by their elemental mastery, capable of
overcoming the defences of virtually any foe.</p>
<p>Beyond the Iron Wall forces of the Sultan operate in small, mobile
companies, each with a particular mission to accomplish. They hunt down
apostates that have gone to serve Shaytans, look for the relics from the
time of the Prophets, or seek to recover lost treasures and books of
knowledge from the ruins</p>
<p>of the fallen Caliphates. Though an understanding between the Church
and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the
commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not
hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment
against the infidels who</p>
<p>unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of
honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who
dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe.</p>
<p><em>In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!
Praise be to Allah, The Beneficent King, The Creator of the Universe,
Lord</em></p>
<p><em>of the Three Worlds, Who set up The Firmament without Pillars in
its Stead and Who stretched out the Earth even as a Bed; and Grace, and
Prayer-Blessing be</em></p>

Variant: Fida’i of Alamut – The Cabal of</u></h3>
<p><u>Assassins</u></p>
<p>The pact between the Iron Sultanate and the Assassin fortress of
Alamut ensures that the Sultan is served by the exquisitely skilled
killers of the Old Man of the Mountain in exchange for independence of
the Assassin’s domain.</p>
<p>But though most outsiders know the Assassins through their service to
the forces of the Iron Wall, sometimes during the dark of night small,
deadly bands move silently into the hellscape of No Man’s Land. In
deepest secrecy Rashid al-Din Sinan, the undisputed ruler of Alamut
dispatches his hand-picked disciples on Missions of his own,
communicating their orders with no spoken words, signs nor written
messages, but talking directly</p>
<p>to them in their dreams. What the purpose of such operations is
no-one knows, and not even the most sadistic Heretic torturer-priest has
been able to make them divulge the secrets of Alamut from captured
Assassins. These warbands are known as <em>Fida’i </em>(which means
‘Sacrifice’), dedicated to completing their mission and returning to
Alamut to receive rewards said to be able to match those of Paradise
itself. They are led by a Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of
Alamut, with two fully-trained members of the Order. A number of trainee
acolytes will serve them during the mission, eager to prove their mettle
and be initiated into the Order of Assassins.</p>
<p>Alamut is also a home to a renegade sect of Ismaili Dervishes,
warrior monks sworn to poverty and a lethal way of fighting. They
accompany the Assassins on their secret missions as an act of piety and
payment for their shelter, and their whirling dance of death has been
the end of many a disbeliever.</p>
<h6 id="fidai-of-alamut-rules">Fida’i of Alamut Rules</h6>
<p>The Fida’i of Alamut Warband has the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Flock of Assassins: </strong>The Fida’i of Alamut can have
up to three Assassins. The warband must include a Master Assassin that
counts as one of the</p>

<p>; <strong>Master Assassin: </strong>A Master Assassin has the</p>

<p>; <strong>Assassin Acolytes: </strong>Up to three Azebs of the</p>
<p>warband can have the Keyword <em>INFILTRATOR </em>at</p>
<p>the cost of +10 ducats per model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Alamut Alone: </strong>The warband may not include</p>
<p>Yüzbaşı, Alchemist, Janissaries, Lions of Jabir or</p>
<p>Brazen Bulls.</p>
<p>; <strong>Killing Squad: </strong>Your warband may have a single</p>
<p>Fireteam. These Fireteams may consist of any two models from your
warband. Models in Fireteams</p>
<p>gain the Keyword <em>FIRETEAM</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Dervishes: </strong>The warband may include up to</p>

declare whether or not this model will be set up by using Secret Paths.
A model using the Secret Paths is not set up on the battlefield at the

first turn.</p>
<p>Starting in the second turn, you may activate these models. When you
do, set up the model in contact with an edge of the battlefield but more
than 8” away from all enemy models at the start of its activation. If
both players have such models, the starting player declares whether one
of their models is deployed or not first, followed by the other player.
Alternate as normal until all such models have been declared as using
Secret Paths or not.</p>

<p><u>The House of Wisdom</u></p>
<p><em>“Read in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who Created man, out
of a clot of congealed blood: Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,
He Who taught the pen, Taught man that which he knew not.”</em></p>
<p>-Surah 96</p>
<p>The House of Wisdom is the pre-eminent centre of learning within the
Iron Sultanate. Its libraries, workshops, forges, gardens of exotic and
wondrous plants, hospitals and observatories are unmatched.</p>
<p>Within its halls are mechanical marvels and weapons from far-off
lands, as well as trophies captured by the Sultan’s forces and brought
to be examined by the learned scholars of the House of Wisdom.
Philosophers and theologists debate in its chambers; <em>ghanzal
</em>and <em>qasīda </em>poets compose verses describing the beauty and
pain of life. Thus it is no wonder that the House attracts the greatest
minds of the age to study in its hallowed halls, from within the
Sultanate and far beyond the Iron Wall.</p>
<p>In its laboratories guarded by the faithful <em>Kavass</em>, the
Jabirean Alchemists dissect and study the War Beasts of Shaitan so their
weaknesses can be laid bare and exploited by the Believers. At such
times, their roars of rage and pain echo through the porphyry corridors
of the House.</p>
<p>To maintain a degree of independence, regardless of the royal
funding, the House of Wisdom performs many services for the Sultan’s
armies. Their best alchemists work with the Sultanate foundries where
the Great Cannons of the Iron Wall are cast. Takwin creations are
provided to bolster the army of Those Who Believe, as are suits of
armour and alchemical ammunition. The House of Wisdom also maintains the
Sultanate fleet of airships, which both guard the realms of Those Who
Believe against enemy air forces and maintain vigil over lands under
darkness. They make regular excursions deep into enemy territory to
witness whether the Great Sandstorm still covers the Two Holy Places,
reporting any news back to the Sultan.</p>
<p>In exchange, the masters of the House of Wisdom have freedom to
despatch their own excursions and</p>
<p>expeditions into the lands beyond the wall, to seek tomes of
knowledge lost in the dark and terrible days when</p>
<p>the forces of Jahannam overran much of the Levant and great cities
fell like blossoms of a Jasmine flower in fiery heat. Sometimes they are
journeys to capture an especially ferocious beast of the enemy. At other
times they seek to capture or kill Heretic Alchemists which they see as
both an offence to their craft and a threat to the entire world.</p>
<p>These journeys are exceedingly dangerous and they are not undertaken
lightly. Each Alchemist dispatched on such a journey is an irreplaceable
loss, and since they operate under their own authority, they cannot
expect direct support from the Sultan’s forces. Many noble <em>Fāris
</em>warriors have taken oaths to protect these scholars in their
journeys, as well as their own Kavass bodyguards sworn to fight and die
in defence of their Masters.</p>
<h6 id="house-of-wisdom-rules">House of Wisdom Rules</h6>
<p>The House of Wisdom warband has the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Alchemists: </strong>The House of Wisdom warband may have
up to two Alchemists and must include at least one. This warband treats
Alchemist Armour as</p>
<p>if they had a <em>LIMIT </em>of 2.</p>
<p>; <strong>Pride of Jabir</strong>: The warband may include up to</p>
<p>three Lions of Jabir.</p>
<p>; <strong>Private Venture</strong>: The warband may not include</p>
<p>any Azebs, Janissaries, Yüzbaşi or Assassins.</p>
<p>; <strong>Noble Guardians</strong>: The warband may include up</p>
<p>to two Fāris – noble warriors sworn to protect the House of Wisdom.
They use the Janissary stats but</p>
<p>have the Keywords <em>ELITE </em>and <em>STRONG</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Kavass</strong>: Kavass are sworn guardians of the
House</p>
<p>of Wisdom. They use Azebs stats but cannot buy the Keyword
<em>SKIRMISHER</em>. Instead, up to three Kavass can increase their
Melee Characteristic by <em>+1 DICE</em></p>
<p>(to +0D) at the cost of +5 ducats per model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Weapon Collections</strong>: When you create this</p>
<p>warband, choose two weapons. These weapons must be found in either
the Armouries of New Antioch or the Trench Pilgrims. These weapons must
not already be present in the Iron Sultanate Armoury.</p>
<p>Your warband may acquire one from New Antioch and one from the Trench
Pilgrim armoury, following all of the same limitations and costs of the
original lists. Only one weapon can be picked from this list. If lost in
battle, it can be repurchased by paying the indicated cost.</p>
<p><u>Secrets of the House of Wisdom</u></p>
<p>Any Alchemist of the warband may buy any one of these Abilities at
the cost indicated below. You cannot have duplicates of these abilities
in the Warband, as the House of Wisdom does not want to risk depleting
the number of their scholars in a single discipline.</p>
<h6 id="medicine-15-ducats">Medicine 15 ducats</h6>
<p>This Alchemist is a student of Ibn Sina’s School of Medicine. The
model is equipped with tools for healing from the House of Wisdom. The
Alchemist can take an <em>ACTION </em>with <em>+1 DICE </em>to remove up
to two <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>or a single <em>INFECTION MARKER </em>from
any one friendly model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow
one friendly model (including themselves) who is Down to regain their
footing. This training and these tools are an improvement upon the
standard Medi-Kit and therefore a model with this Secret cannot carry a
Medi-Kit.</p>
<h6 id="cartography-geometry-20-ducats">Cartography &amp; Geometry 20
ducats</h6>
<p>The Alchemist has studied long and hard the sciences of cartography
and geometry. At the beginning of each battle, immediately before any
models are deployed, up to two models in your warband gain the Keyword
<em>INFILTRATOR</em>, This ability cannot affect an Alchemist or a model
with a base larger than 32mm. In addition, the warband may re- roll one
Exploration dice in the Exploration phase if you wish. The second result
stands.</p>
<h6 id="secrets-of-takwin-20-ducats">Secrets of Takwin 20 ducats</h6>
<p>The Alchemist has bound their Takwin creature to themselves with
unbreakable bonds. If the Alchemist is hit by an attack while within 1”
of their Homunculus, you may redirect the hit to the Homunculi instead.
Determine the injuries and additional effects exactly as if the weapon
just hit the Homunculi.</p>
<h6 id="chemistry-alchemy-25-ducats">Chemistry &amp; Alchemy 25
ducats</h6>
<p>Before the battle starts, but after all models (including
<em>INFILTRATORS</em>) are deployed, you may place a rectangular
elemental obstacle 2” wide and 6” long. It counts both as Difficult
Terrain and Dangerous Terrain, and damage it causes has the Keyword
<em>FIRE</em>, <em>GAS </em>or <em>SHRAPNEL </em>(chosen when the
obstacle is placed). It cannot be placed within 6” of any model or on
top of any other Terrain.</p>
<h6 id="philosophy-poetry-and-theology-20-ducats">Philosophy, Poetry and
Theology 20 ducats</h6>
<p>The Alchemist is well-versed in the hidden truths of the universe and
of the Divine, and has a calm and clear mind. The warband gains <em>+1
DICE </em>to all Morale Rolls, cannot become Shaken and the Alchemist
plus another model of your choice is immune to the effects of the
Keyword <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p><u>Takwin Creatures</u></p>
<p>You can bring one Takwin creature for each Alchemist in your warband.
Each Takwin creature must be associated with an Alchemist in your
warband. If a Takwin creature’s associated Alchemist is killed
(typically by acquiring three scars), that Takwin creature cannot be
fielded, its equipment cannot be changed and no Alchemical Formulae may
be applied to it. When you acquire a new Alchemist, if you have any
unallocated Takwin creatures, you must allocate that new Alchemist with
one of your unallocated Takwin creatures. Instead of using Glory, you
must buy them with ducats as indicated on the list below.</p>

<p>The homunculus cannot be equipped with any weapons, armour or

<p class="heading" id="abilities-23">Abilities</p>
<p>; <strong>Re-creation</strong>: If the Homunculus is taken Out of
Action during battle, and is deemed to have been killed in the
post-battle sequence, you do not have to remove it from your roster.
Instead, you can spend 40 ducats at any time between battles to bring it
back to life with all of its weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>; <strong>Artificial Body</strong>: Created through the Jabirean
alchemy, the Homunculus has no vital organs and they have to</p>
<p>be dismembered in order to kill them. All injury rolls against the
Homunculus are made with <em>-1 DICE</em>.</p>
<p class="heading" id="keywords-27">Keywords</p>
<p><em>SULTANATE</em></p>
<h6 id="alchemical-formulae">Alchemical formulae</h6>
<p>You may buy any of these Alchemical Formulae for your Homunculus,
either during its creation or later during any Post-Battle Sequence, as
long as you pay the price of each formula. Once bought they are
permanent.</p>
<p>You can never have more than one Alchemic Formula of the same type
applied into a single Takwin creature unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>; <strong>Wings (30 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus gains a new
movement mode: 8”/Flying.</p>
<p>; <strong>Elemental Resistance (40 ducats)</strong>: Attacks made
against the Homunculus that have the Keywords <em>FIRE</em></p>
<p>and/or <em>GAS </em>suffer a <em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to injure it.
Also the Homunculus does not suffer additional <em>BLOOD</em></p>
<p><em>MARKERS </em>from attacks with Keywords <em>FIRE </em>and/or
<em>GAS</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Massive size (30 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus’ size is
increased to huge proportions. It now has a base size of</p>
<p>50mm and it gains the Keyword <em>TOUGH</em>. This formula cannot be
combined with the Wings formula.</p>
<p>; <strong>Enslaved Mind (10 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus gains
the Keyword <em>FIRETEAM </em>along with one model of your</p>
<p>choice in the Warband. The other model can only form a Fireteam with
this Homunculi, not with any other</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>; <strong>Human hands (10 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus can buy
and wield any weapon allowed in the Iron Sultanate</p>
<p>warband or House of Wisdom list, though they cannot select <em>ELITE
</em>only items, grenades or items limited</p>
<p>to specific units (such as Assassins). They can also carry a Trench
Shield or a Fire Shield. This will apply to the Additional Arms formula
as well. Cannot be combined with the Wings formula.</p>
<p>; <strong>Inhuman Strength (15 ducats)</strong>: The musculature of
the Homunculus is reinforced, replaced and</p>
<p>strengthened. It now has a base size of 32mm (or 50mm if it also has
Massive size). The Homunculus gains <em>+1</em></p>
<p><em>DICE </em>to its Melee characteristic and the Keyword
<em>STRONG</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Terrifying Appearance (10 ducats)</strong>: Whether by
captivating beauty or a terrifying appearance, this</p>
<p>Homunculus gains the Keyword <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Additional Arm (15 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus can
perform an additional attack <em>ACTION </em>in Melee or</p>
<p>Ranged combat without any penalty. Therefore, if making attacks with
three melee weapons, only a single</p>
<p>weapon would need to be declared an Off-Hand weapon (suffering the
appropriate penalties). It has three hands to carry weapons if combined
with Human Hands, and may equip weapons and a shield in any combination,
as long as it has hands free to do so. In this case the Homunculi can
make up to two Ranged Attack <em>ACTIONS </em>(if it has sufficient
weapons and number of hands to carry them), and up to three Melee Attack
<em>ACTIONS </em>(if armed with three one-handed weapons); or one Melee
Attack <em>ACTION </em>with a two-handed weapon and one Melee Attack
<em>ACTION </em>with a one-handed weapon.</p>
<p>; <strong>Two heads (5 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus has two heads
and therefore can have two sets of eyes via Alchemical</p>
<p>Formula.</p>
<p>; <strong>Hypnotic Eyes (15 ducats)</strong>: Enemies suffer <em>-1
DICE </em>to hit the Homunculus in Melee. Does not affect</p>
<p>Sniper Priests or enemies with the keyword <em>BLACK GRAIL</em>.
Cannot be combined with Hawk Eyes without Two</p>
<p>Heads.</p>
<p>; <strong>Hawk Eyes (10 ducats)</strong>: The eyesight of the
Homunculus is based on that of a predatory bird. It can add
<em>+1</em></p>
<p><em>DICE </em>to its Ranged Attack characteristic. Cannot be combined
with Hypnotic Eyes without Two Heads.</p>
<p>; <strong>Startling Speed (10 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus adds
<em>+1 DICE </em>to its Dash <em>ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Seal of Solomon (10 ducats)</strong>: This Formula greatly
enhances the intelligence of the Homunculus and makes</p>
<p>it painfully aware of its artificial existence. It can now buy and
use Equipment from the Sultanate Warband Armoury as long as it is not
limited to <em>ELITE </em>models. Note that one helmet protects a
Homunculus with two</p>
<p>heads normally and the Two Heads Formula does not allow the purchase
of two different kinds of headgear.</p>
<p>; <strong>Gargantuan Size (20 ducats)</strong>: Can only be bought if
the Homunculus already has the Human Hands,</p>
<p>Inhuman Strength and Massive Size Formulas. The Homunculus now has a
Base Size of 60mm and it can now</p>
<p>use one Brazen Bull Only weapon.</p>
<p>; <strong>Regenerative Tissue (25 ducats)</strong>: The Homunculus
has an astonishing healing factor and can remove one</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKER </em>every time it is Activated, if it has any.</p>

<h1 id="f">F</h1>
<p>or three hundred years the Principality of New Antioch has stood
defiantly as the focal point of the Church and the Faithful at the very
edge of the shadow cast by the Gate</p>
<p>of Hell. It is the Home of All Our Hopes, the bulwark against Heretic
forces and the first line of defence against the devil’s might. Should
New Antioch</p>
<p>fall, the Levant will be lost and the path to heartlands of the
Church will be wide open.</p>
<p>War has never left this corner of the world. The ancient city of
Antioch was destroyed by a mysterious demonic weapon in the year 1545,
but the Faithful never gave up their positions in the ruins. Despite the
lethal demonic essence emanating from the crater that was left behind,
the garrison held on, even as mighty Constantinople fell to the legions
of Kimaris, Marquis of Hell.</p>
<p>Before it was destroyed, the ancient city of Antioch was always the
first line of defence to be put to test. Thus it is no wonder that in
the year 1559 the Sword Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify
the city, and that a yearly tithe is to be sent to New Antioch by all
the Faithful nations, though this levy is rarely in form of coin.
Instead, endless supply trains of foodstuffs, tools, ammunition,
weaponry, machinery and skilled workers and engineers come from across
Europa and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the African dominions.</p>
<p>Since those days New Antioch has grown to be the most important
fortress-city in the world, the Sword and the Shield of Europa and
Africa. All the princes of the Church and heads of the various states
and domains who oppose Hell understand that it is better to fight their
battles against the Heretics as far away from their heartlands as
possible. To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and
its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been
breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle
shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the
walls, keeping a vigilant watch over the walls day and night.</p>
<p>More than anything else, it is the volunteers who come to serve under
the Banner of Christ that ensure</p>
<p>the continuous existence of the Principality. Thus in the streets of
the city one can hear hundreds of languages and dialects. One might
observe hussars of the Polish- Lithuanian commonwealth brushing
shoulders with the last remnants of the Varangian Guard, or hear the
sermons of a street preacher from Eire extolling the soldiery of
Ethiopia to lay down their lives for the holy cause. Perhaps they might
even witness the Church Engineers procession taking their latest
invention to be tested in the front lines.</p>
<p>As the nominal supreme commander of all the Faithful armed forces,
the Duke of New Antioch is a title of unrivalled prestige and honour.
But despite swearing fealty to the Duke, in reality most of the troops
from across all of Christendom who come to do battle against Hell
operate in units of their own, taking commands from their leaders and
making their own strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Still, some soldiers do indeed renounce their citizenship and take up
the cross, and come to serve under Duke Constantine alone. Thus the
standing army of the Principality is the greatest single fighting force
the Faithful can muster, and those who serve on the walls of the Home of
Hopes are rightfully proud of their livery.</p>
<p>In recent years the Duke has despatched small forces into No Man’s
Land to gather intelligence, look for artefacts of power, conduct raids
on Heretic forces, secure strategic strongpoints and loot the
battlefields for the wealth of coin and weaponry scattered across the
tortured landscape that stretches between New Antioch and the Heretic
domains over the centuries. These warbands are simply given commission
by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own
forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the
Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders
who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for
loot, supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these warbands
often come to blows, not just with Heretical forces, but with competing
rivals and crazed Trench Pilgrims.</p>

<p><u>New Antioch Fireteams</u></p>
<p>Your warband may have up to two Fireteams. These Fireteams may
consist of any two models from your warband. Models in Fireteams gain
the Keyword <em>FIRETEAM</em>. Fireteams gain the Concentrated Attack
rule:</p>
<p>; <em>FIRETEAM</em><strong>: </strong>This model is part of a
<em>FIRETEAM </em>made up of two models. All models that are part of the
same <em>FIRETEAM </em>can be activated at the same time without the
opponent getting their turn in between and can take their <em>ACTIONS
</em>in any order they wish, switching between the two models.</p>
<p>Note that if the Activation of either member of the <em>FIRETEAM
</em>forcefully ends (due to a failed <em>RISKY ACTION </em>for
example), it ends both Activations.</p>
<p>Allies cannot be part of a <em>FIRETEAM</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Concentrated Attack</strong>: If a model in the</p>
<p><em>FIRETEAM </em>makes any kind of Attack <em>ACTION </em>(ranged or
melee) against an opponent, where the other member of their <em>FIRETEAM
</em>has already hit it with an attack <em>ACTION </em>during the same
activation, the cost of a Bloodbath is reduced to three <em>BLOOD
MARKERS </em>against this opponent, whether the model is standing or
<em>Down</em>.</p>

<p>1 Lieutenant <strong>(Cost: 70 Ducats)</strong></p>
<p>Your warband must include a Lieutenant when it is created.</p>
<p><em>Lieutenants are leaders of small squads or platoons of New
Antioch’s soldiers, playing a fundamental role on the distant frontlines
of the Trench Crusade, displaying unwavering resolve in preserving the
unity and morale of their troops. Lieutenants might be the favoured son
or daughter of a noble family or gained their rank by impressing their
superiors with their exceptional strategic acumen and audacious
bravery.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to their command role, they are also responsible for
acquiring new weapons, arms, equipment and food for their troops. All
too often this requires looting the battlefields of No Man’s Land or
even raiding settlements, since resupply can be sporadic at
best.</em></p>
<p><em>Having rightfully earned their position, Lieutenants enjoy the
privilege of selecting their preferred arms and armour, often with the
pick of the rarest battlefield finds. It is not uncommon for a
Lieutenant to wield a distinctive weapon, perhaps a family heirloom, an
idiosyncratic affectation or an ostentatious piece providing some
much-needed swagger.</em></p>

Variant: Papal States Intervention Force</u></h3>
<p>The Papal states who all operate under the command of the Supreme
Pontiff of Rome rather than the Duke of New Antioch are sometimes
dispatched to the front lines to perform a specific duty such as hunting
down</p>
<p>and eliminating dangerous Heretic leaders or recovering artefacts of
great spiritual importance.</p>
<p>These Warbands are typically quite small but have access to extremely
elite soldiers and specialist equipment. They are led by utterly devoted
warrior-monks and priests hand-picked by the Pope.</p>
<h6 id="rules">Rules</h6>
<p>The Papal States Intervention Force has the following special
rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Specialist Force: </strong>A Papal States Intervention
Force is recruited with 500 ducats <strong>and </strong>11 Glory Points
when creating a warband for a campaign. When recruiting a warband for a
one-off battle, we</p>
<p>recommend using 700 ducats and 15 Glory Points.</p>
<p>; <strong>Swiss Guard: </strong>Up to four non-<em>ELITE
</em>troopers</p>
<p>and the Lieutenant can be upgraded into Swiss Guards at the cost of 5
ducats each. They are</p>
<p>immune to <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Supreme Blessing: </strong>One model in the warband</p>
<p>may carry the crucifix given by the Supreme Pontiff. This model can
take further <em>ACTIONS </em>if it fails in an attempted <em>RISKY
ACTION</em>. Note that the action fails, but you are allowed to try any
other <em>ACTIONS </em>on your profile without losing the Activation. If
the crucifix is lost, a new one can be acquired at the cost</p>
<p>of 3 Glory Points.</p>
<p>; <strong>Far from home: </strong>The Papal Intervention Force</p>
<p>may have no Trench Moles.</p>
<p>; <strong>Vatican’s representative: </strong>Papal States Warband</p>
<p>must include a Trench Cleric but does not have to</p>
<p>include a Lieutenant.</p>
<p>; <strong>Lector: </strong>Any Trench Cleric in the Papal</p>
<p>Intervention Force can select the following prayer</p>
<p>in addition to the ones usually available to a Trench Cleric:</p>
<p>; Arise and be Healed! Select one friendly</p>
<p>model within 3” of the Priest and take</p>
<p>a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. If successful, the warrior immediately

<h3 id="warband-variant-eire-rangers"><u>Warband Variant: Eire
Rangers</u></h3>
<p>Eire is a stronghold of the Church and an ancient centre of learning.
Due to the constant and devastating raids of the Heretic Navy, they are
bitter enemies of the Infernal forces. The Emerald Isle has endured
hunger and ravaged by the Black Grail, as well as a full-fledged
invasion aimed at destroying the famed House of Manuscripts where many
of the holiest of texts are kept. After this century of ruthless battles
and brutal guerrilla warfare against the invaders, the warriors of Eire
are now masters of skirmish fighting, hit-and-run tactics and
ambushes.</p>
<p>Elite Fianna warrior-hunters are especially adept at these guerrilla
tactics: they uphold the ancient tradition of a band of roving warriors
living off the land. While seen as trouble-makers and godless
hellraisers, they</p>
<p>are nevertheless expert skirmishers, and easily find employment in
the warbands who take the Cross and travel to New Antioch to strike back
at the enemy. These warriors adorn themselves with grisly trophies in
the manner of their pagan ancestors, carrying skulls of the vanquished –
much to the irritation of the Church.</p>
<p>Due to the ravages of the wars, the island nation has few resources
for heavy armour or most intricate automatic weapons, but they more than
make up for this with their skilled light infantry and knowledge of the
lay of the land. So when the Poet-King Tadhg O’Connor dispatches his
famed Rangers to aid the Principality of New Antioch instead of paying
the yearly tithe of Vienna, the Duke is more than happy to accept these
fierce warriors instead.</p>
<p>A rare latent Berserker trait runs in a few warrior bloodlines of
Eire. It can be made to manifest with the Chemical Communion of the
blood of the Meta-Christ. Such fighters enter a state of battle-rage,
where no bullet or blade seems to cause them any harm.</p>
<h6 id="rules-1">Rules</h6>
<p>The Eire Rangers has the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Fianna: </strong>Any Shocktroopers in an Eire Warband can
be made a member of <em>Fianna</em>, the famed</p>
<p>warrior-hunters. They cost +10 ducats each and have</p>
<p>the Keywords <em>SKIRMISHER </em>and <em>INFILTRATOR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Carnyx: </strong>Your army can purchase a special</p>
<p>Carnyx instead of a generic musical instrument. This horn is
identical to a musical instrument (including equipment restrictions and
<em>LIMIT</em>), except it can be carried by an <em>ELITE </em>model and
the model carrying</p>
<p>it causes <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Hit-and-run tactics: </strong>If a model of this
warband</p>
<p>uses the Retreat <em>ACTION </em>to move away from Combat, enemies
have a <em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to hit rolls with their free attack.</p>
<p>; <strong>Berserker: </strong>Either your Lieutenant or one of the
Fianna can be a Berserker. This model is immune to <em>FEAR </em>and
disregards any <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>from any source. Berserkers never
wear armour, though they can carry a Trench Shield. Add +15 Ducats
to</p>
<p>the cost of this model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Strong in faith: </strong>Eire is a bastion of the
Church,</p>
<p>with many famed warrior-priests who travel to war. The warband may
have up to two Trench Clerics and they can each choose to replace their
<em>Onwards, Christian Soldiers! </em>ability with one from the list</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>; <strong>Loose organisation: </strong>Your warband may only</p>
<p>have up to one <em>FIRETEAM </em>from the New Antioch Fireteams
feature. Additionally, your Lieutenant loses the <em>On my command!
</em>ability and gains the</p>
<p>Keyword <em>SKIRMISHER</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Light Infantry: </strong>The warband is allowed to</p>
<p>field only one Mechanized Heavy Infantry trooper. No model (save for
the single Mechanized Heavy Infantry) may carry a <em>HEAVY </em>weapon
or wear Heavy or Machine Armour. This does not apply to Combat</p>
<p>Engineers’ Satchel Charges.</p>
<p>; <strong>Followers of St. Patrick: </strong>If playing a
Campaign,</p>
<p>the patron of the warband is automatically Saint Patrick.</p>
<h6 id="eire-trench-cleric-abilities">Eire Trench Cleric Abilities</h6>
<p>; <strong>Away, Serpents! </strong>Select any enemy within 12” of the
Priest and take a <em>RISKY ACTION </em>(targeting models on 40mm or
larger bases incur <em>-1 DICE </em>penalty to this roll). If
successful, the enemy model goes <em>Down </em>immediately, slithering
on its belly like a snake.</p>
<p>; <strong>Arise and be Healed! </strong>Select one friendly model
within 3” of the Priest and take a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. If successful,
the warrior immediately stands up if <em>Down</em>, and loses up to
<em>D3 BLOOD MARKERS </em>or <em>INFECTION MARKERS </em>(or any
combination) of your choice.</p>
<h3
id="warband-variant-stoßtruppen-of-the-free-state-of-prussia"><u>Warband
Variant: Stoßtruppen of the Free State of Prussia</u></h3>
<p>When the need to take out an enemy strongpoint or assault an
especially powerful defensive line of trenches or redoubts arises, the
Duke of Antioch often calls upon the famed Stoßtruppen forces of the
Free State of Prussia. These elite units often operate in deep forward
positions, and quite often they carry secret orders or</p>
<p>specific missions from the Princes of the Church or the New Antioch
High Command.</p>
<p>The Free State Shocktroopers are selected and trained specifically to
perform lightning assaults, master the firearms of close assault, and
operate in Fireteams that are perfectly synchronised in their combined
arms tactics. Admittance to this elite group is strictly by merit. All
members must be decorated athletes, under 25 years of age, unmarried and
must have demonstrated a high level of aggression on the battlefield. Of
all the soldiers serving Prussia, Stoßtruppen have by far the highest
casualty rate. When inducted into the ranks, all swear an oath at the
Köningsber Cathedral: <em>“To each, his own, to me, death”.</em></p>
<h6 id="rules-2">Rules</h6>
<p>The Stoßtrupp of the Free State of Prussia warband has the following
special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Expert Fireteams: </strong>You may have up to three
<em>FIRETEAMS </em>from the New Antioch Fireteams feature.</p>
<p>; <strong>Masters of the Grenade: </strong>Models of the</p>
<p>Stoßtruppen Warband add 4” range to all of their</p>
<p><em>GRENADE </em>weapons.</p>
<p>; <strong>Forward Positions: </strong>Up to two Shocktroops can</p>
<p>have the Keyword <em>INFILTRATOR </em>at the cost of</p>
<p>+10 ducats per model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Rapid Assault: </strong>At the cost of +5 ducats per</p>
<p>model, any Shocktroopers and Lieutenants may add</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE </em>to all their Dash <em>ACTIONS</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Specialised Equipment: </strong>This warband has</p>
<p><em>LIMIT:4 </em>for Submachine guns. Automatic Shotguns and
Automatic Pistols are <strong>not </strong>limited to <em>ELITE</em>.
The warband may have no Grenade</p>
<p>Launchers and only one Machine Gun.</p>
<p>; <strong>Troop Selection: </strong>The warband must have at</p>
<p>least two shocktroopers and can have up to eight.</p>
<p>the warband can have only one mechanised heavy infantry, one sniper
priest and no trench moles.</p>
<p>; <strong>Lightly-armoured: </strong>Apart from mechanised</p>
<p>heavy infantry and the lieutenant, no model in the warband can be
equipped with reinforced or</p>
<p>machine armour.</p>
<p>; <strong>Light Melee: </strong>Prussian shocktroopers lose the</p>
<p>Assault Drill ability.</p>

<p><strong>Tank-splitter sword 15 ducats</strong></p>
<p><em>It takes years of gruelling Mensur practice and field drills to
acquire the required precision and speed to use the specialist
tank-splitter swords of the Gardekorps. Despite their great size (often
over 6 feet long!) they are remarkably light, and due to the large
quantities of Orichalcum used in their forging process, they are
virtually unbreakable. They are often used to disable tanks and other
armoured vehicles by either slicing their armour open or disabling them
with an accurate swing to sever their tracks. Before any battle they are
treated with a special metal-melting chemical compound which melts the
armour, making it far deadlier against armoured targets than those who
wear none.</em></p>

<h3 id="warband-variant-kingdom-of-alba-assault-detachment"><u>Warband
Variant: Kingdom of Alba Assault Detachment</u></h3>
<p>Hailing from the Scottish Highlands where the Church is strong, these
men (and a few fierce women!) come to New Antioch in search of glory,
forgiveness of their sins, as well as dreams of acquiring valuable loot
to send back to their island home, but above all to get their hands on
some Devil-worshippers!</p>
<p>The Heretic submarine fleet harries the shores of the Kingdom
constantly, carrying off their young in chains to be sacrificed in the
dark altars of the Arch-devils and their hatred towards Hell’s forces
runs deep. The fleet of Britain and their famed moving fortress are
reserved in guarding their own shores, causing friction and resentment
among their northern neighbours, whose coastal defences are far less
comprehensive. As is the tradition in Alba, these warbands favour close
quarters combat and fierce charges over defence and long-range
attacks.</p>
<h6 id="rules-3">Rules</h6>
<p>The Kingdom of Alba Assault Detachment has the following special
rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Rampant Charge: </strong>All models in this warband ignore
the penalty for Defended Obstacles.</p>
<p>; <strong>Melee-focused: </strong>Mechanized Heavy Infantry</p>

<p>; <strong>Highland Machine Armour: </strong>Models in this</p>

<p>penalty to charging imposed by the armour.</p>
<p>; <strong>Highland Strength</strong>: The Lieutenant of the</p>

<p>; <strong>Strained Supply</strong>: This warband has
<em>LIMIT:1</em></p>
<p>for Grenade Launchers, Submachine Guns, Machine</p>
<p>Guns, Automatic Shotguns and Sniper Rifles.</p>
<p>; <strong>Bagpipes: </strong>Your warband can purchase special</p>
<p>bagpipes instead of a generic musical instrument. These bagpipes are
identical to a musical instrument (including their equipment
restrictions and <em>LIMIT</em>), but friendly models within 4” of the
model carrying</p>
<p>them are immune to <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Brave: </strong>The warband adds <em>+1 DICE </em>to

<h3 id="warband-variant-expeditionary-forces-of-abyssinia"><u>Warband
Variant: Expeditionary Forces of Abyssinia</u></h3>
<p>Most of what was once the ancient realm of Egypt now rests under the
Shadow of Hell and the stronghold</p>
<p>of the servants of the Prince of Greed, who has long dreamed of
plundering the whole continent of its riches. Beautiful Alexandria and
even mighty Cairo have fallen, their ports serving as anchorage for the
heretic fleet and mustering grounds for Hell’s legions as they strike
south and west.</p>
<p>But thus far, Mammon’s plans to sweep across the northern coast of
Africa all the way to Mali and Axum has been frustrated. For this front
is every bit as bitterly contested as the European theatre of war. Here
the heretic legions are opposed by a coalition of Nubia, Numidia and the
Solomonic Empire of Abyssinia (more commonly known as the Ethiopian
Empire in Africa) that have thrown their lot together to resist</p>
<p>the invader. Blood stains the waters of the Nile as the coalition
struggles to contain the grinding offensives of Mammon’s Legion of the
Ten Golden Horns. The plan of the Prince of Greed is two-fold: to
overcome the holy churches of Lalibela – desecrating and auctioning off
the legendary relics within the churches and cathedrals of Axum – and to
claim the fabled gold mines of the</p>
<p>Queen of Sheba for himself, which he covets beyond any other treasure
trove on Earth.</p>
<p>War has honed the soldiers of Ethiopia into masters of mobile warfare
and taking the enemy on in loose</p>
<p>formation, a style of fighting well-suited to their rugged country
where scarce roads restrict the movements of large armies. Most levies
fight armed with rifles, seeking to close in on the enemy to ensure the
effectiveness of their volleys; while the Chewa are the warrior-elite,
trained in hand-to-hand combat since childhood.</p>
<p>They are encouraged to take on lions and other fierce predators as
part of their upbringing, and warriors that have taken down a male lion
single-handedly have the honour of wearing its mane as a headdress.
Their famed war cry “Together! Together!” is often the last thing the
invaders hear.</p>
<p>Claiming a direct lineage from the legendary queen of Sheba and King
Solomon, the Emperors of Abyssinia are staunch members of the Faithful
alliance, and the representative of the African continent in the Sword
Congress of Vienna. It is a matter of pride and prestige to the House of
Solomon that the tithe to New Antioch is met punctually. So once in
seven years the Negarit war drums sound the kitet, the call to arms. The
volunteers gather at Axum, the spiritual capital of the nation, where
the Ark of the Covenant is said to be kept under the</p>
<p>watchful eyes of warrior monks who are born to their role and never
leave their post.</p>
<p>There is never any lack of warriors willing to join the expeditionary
force to aid New Antioch. Adventure, unrivalled status given to those
who go to serve the Duke and the chance to fight the enemy in their
heartlands ensures that the bravest young soldiers compete for the
chance to join the expeditionary force.</p>
<p>Before being accepted into this force, all volunteers to New Antioch
must make a pilgrimage to Abuna Yemata Guh, the chapel that rests on a
mountainside at a dizzying height of some 8500 feet. It is the</p>
<p>most inaccessible place of worship in the world, and volunteers must
travel to receive the blessing from this shrine in the sky carrying
their full military kit and gear. Miraculously, there have been
exceedingly few deaths caused by soldiers losing their footing and
plummeting to their deaths. Each one of those who have fallen have been
found to be a heretic infiltrator, and their broken and rotting bodies
are left unburied as a warning to those traitors who would defile the
sanctity of the shrine.</p>
<p>Once the pilgrimage is done, the forces assemble and are laden with
gold, silver, precious stones, icons and holy relics as gifts from the
Emperor to the Duke. The warriors of the Emperor march to the hidden
ports of the coast that are still free of the enemy. There is no land
route for the warriors of Ethiopia to reach the Principality and the
Heretic Fleet dominates both the Erythraean Sea and the Red Sea, leaving
the perilous crossing of the mediterranean as the only viable
option.</p>
<p>Thus there is the war on the waves of the Mediterranean as the
Faithful fleet clashes with heretic dreadnoughts. Ships will be sunk and
the gold from the mines of the Queen of Sheba is lost to the sea, but
when the songs and drums of the warriors of Solomonic Throne can be
heard in the harbour and echoing on the famed walls of New Antioch, the
citizens know that aid has come once more.</p>
<p>Fewer than one in ten volunteers ever return to the rock-hewn
Churches of Lalibela to give thanks for their deliverance. The rest give
their lives in brutal battles in No Man’s Land, like countless millions
before them. In</p>
<p>the eyes of these survivors one can catch a glimpse of the horrors
that have scarred them for life.</p>
<h6 id="rules-4">Rules</h6>
<p>The Expeditionary Force of Abyssinia has the following special
rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>Chewa: </strong>Any shocktroopers or <em>ELITE </em>models

enemies that are in melee combat with a model other than the Chewa. If
this enemy is in melee with 2+ other models, this bonus is increased</p>
<p>to <em>+2 DICE</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Faith of Ethiopia: </strong>The sect of the Sniper
Priests</p>
<p>does not operate in the Solomonic Dynasty, so your</p>
<p>warband cannot contain any Sniper Priests.</p>
<p>; <strong>Flanking Forces: </strong>The warband cannot have</p>

long as they are at least 8” away from any enemy model after
<em>INFILTRATORS </em>are deployed. Vanguard can also be deployed in

<p>; <strong>Short-Range Marksmanship: </strong>Yeomen,</p>
<p>Vanguard and the Lieutenant in this warband gain</p>

<p>pidemics of typhus, malaria, typhoid, smallpox, yellow-fever,
pneumonia, trench fever, Markisian disease and countless others ravage
the trenches and battlefields of the Great War, but they all pale in</p>
<p>comparison to the most dreaded of them all: the Black Grail.</p>
<p>Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, stands apart from the other lords of
Hell, who act mainly through their mortal followers. Instead, when he
periodically gains supremacy in the bitter power struggles of the
archfiends, he sends forth his deadliest curse.</p>
<p>Infused with demonic essence from the bowels of the seventh layer of
Hell, where the putrid fortress of Beelzebub stands, spews forth a
torrent of demonic hell-flies, scorpions, locusts and other infernal
insects.</p>
<p>The Hellgate opens and a veritable tidal wave of foulness emerges,
flowing across the land at startling speed, consuming everything and
leaving indescribable horror in its wake. After nine days the insect
swarm exhausts itself, devouring its own in its insatiable hunger.</p>
<p>The Black Grail is indiscriminate in its hatred of all living things:
its infections can spread to virtually any living biological matter,
which bursts forth with</p>
<p>tumours, boils and weeping pustules. Puddles and ponds of melted
flesh are left in its wake, endless mouths left screaming in their
agony, for the Black Grail destroys the body but leaves the mind intact
to suffer. The Scientist-Priests of the Church and the Alchemists</p>
<p>of the Sultanate fervently look for a way to inoculate their people
against this foulest of diseases, but thus far they are without success.
The only answer is to burn the infected settlements with
specially-constructed</p>
<p>flamethrower tanks that use holy anointing oil as the fuel for their
weapons.</p>
<p>But if this is not done, or the countermeasures are too late, what
happens next is even worse: bodies of men, horses, dogs, insects and
other animals of every kind that are infected by the Black Grail lurch
to their feet, driven by a demonic will. Not living, not dead, they
become vessels to spread the corruption of their master ever</p>
<p>further, forming warbands that strive to find and infect life of any
kind. They also gather things that mortals value and bring this loot as
well as grisly trophies to the feet of the idols of Beelzebub they
erect. Thus the Cult of the Black Grail mocks the devotions of the
Faithful and their prayers.</p>
<p>At the head of such warbands stand the knights of the Order of the
Fly: those most depraved men and women who willingly embrace the Black
Grail and whose devotion Beelzebub finds sufficient. They are granted
weapons, armour and equipment corrupted by the hand of the Archfiend in
exchange for sacrifices brought to the altars of Beelzebub, which these
warbands build wherever they go, objects of grisly horror constructed
from the remains of their victims shaped into the form of monstrous
flies.</p>

<h3 id="black-grail-special-rules"><u>Black Grail Special Rules</u></h3>
<p><strong>Infection Markers: </strong>Some attacks by the weaponry of
the Black Grail causes their opponents to suffer <em>INFECTION
MARKERS</em>. These work in a similar</p>
<p>fashion to <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>. <em>INFECTION MARKERS</em></p>
<p>can be used to modify dice rolls exactly like <em>BLOOD MARKERS
</em>(i.e. <em>ACTION </em>rolls and injury rolls and used in
Bloodbaths). Use a different coloured dice (the more disgusting the
better!) to indicate these markers and place them next to the infected
model.</p>
<p>A model may have up to six <em>INFECTION MARKERS </em>and six
<em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>at the same time. If a model had any
<em>INFECTION MARKERS </em>before, but has none when it is Activated, no
new ones are added to the model – though it can still be re-infected by
further attacks if a model has one or more <em>INFECTION MARKERS
</em>when activated, it gains +1 <em>INFECTION MARKER</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Morale: </strong>Fighting against the Black Grail is a
terrifying prospect. All Morale Tests taken when fighting against any
Black Grail Warband are done with <em>-1 DICE</em>, unless the opposing
warband is Black Grail or a Demonic warband.</p>

<h3 id="warband-variant-dirge-of-the-great-hegemon"><u>Warband Variant:
Dirge of the Great Hegemon</u></h3>
<p>In the annals of the Great War two mighty Hegemons of the Black Grail
have risen: Yersinia Rex, Emperor of Pestilence, and Febris, the rotting
Bride of Beelzebub. Each of them were destroyed, but at an unimaginable
cost to the forces of the Great Tyrant YHWH. Even the great Paladin
Engelier, the Sword of Heaven, died when confronting the might of a
Hegemon.</p>
<p>With the ascension of a Hegemon, the hideous power of the Black Grail
is exalted. Beelzebub grows sleek and fat, and like a magnanimous king,
bestowing blessings and gifts upon his most favoured children.
Beelzebub’s insidious grip over his Grail Thralls greatly increases.
They move with more grace and the exalted blessings of the Grail opens
their ruined minds, allowing them to truly witness the rotting glory of
the Lord of the Flies, enabling them to understand more complex
weaponry. In turn, the nobles that make up the ranks of the Order of the
Fly are given kingly gifts from their mighty liege.</p>
<p>Full of the ascendant power of the Black Grail, how miserable they
become when their Hegemon lord falls in battle. Each Hegemon is unique,
and when slain, it can never be re-created. The ecstasy of the Plague
Knights</p>
<p>in the service of their dread ruler sinks into the deepest despair
from which there is no escape. Their strain of the Black Grail is
shunned by others of their kind and they are no longer welcome at Ekron,
the City of Beelzebub: they are cast out from the Order of the Fly for
their failure. The Hegemon’s strain of disease continues spreading and
creating thralls, but they are born into</p>
<p>a world bereft of their sires, leaving them hopeless and
desolated.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Plague Knights continuously weep cold black blood as
they cry for their lost Dark Paradise that will never be again. The
tantalising dream of a great flood of pestilence that cleanses the earth
is lost forever. Their mournful wails echo and reverberate through No
Man’s Land, a cry of sorrow deeper than any mortal can feel, and
agonising rage of black hatred that no mortal comprehends. They compose
mournful paeans to their lost Hegemon -beautiful yet disturbing songs
that promise nothing but never-ending death.</p>
<p>Such shattered remains of the once-mighty legions of the Hegemon take
their vengeance on any opponent regardless of their allegiance, even
throwing themselves at other Black Grail warbands in futile acts of
regret, trying to feel pain that would at least momentarily dull their
aching feeling of loss. But no such hope exists in their eternal
damnation.</p>
<p>These bands made up of the strains of fallen Hegemons’</p>
<p>once-mighty legions form everlasting funeral processions for their
dead masters. The echo of their dirges accompanies their solemn steps,
taking them from nowhere to nowhere. Their eyes are forever stained by
the foul tears of the Black Grail and their skin turns black and sloughs
off, hanging in tatters like funereal garb. They seek lost artefacts and
broken shards of armour and weapons of their lost liege, fashioning
disturbing and rusted jewellery from these remains where the Hegemon’s
power still lingers beyond the grave. Few things that haunt No Man’s
Land are more dangerous – or ghastlier – than these corruption-ridden
echoes of the dark past, the funeral processions that last until time
itself is no more.</p>
<h6 id="the-dirge-special-rules">The Dirge Special Rules</h6>
<p>The warband has the following special rules:</p>
<p>; <strong>The Executor: </strong>The warband must include an Executor
(use Plague Knight Stats), who has the Keyword <em>TOUGH </em>and Ranged
characteristic of <em>+1</em></p>
<p><em>DICE</em>. The Executor costs 80 ducats.</p>
<p>; <strong>The Lamenters</strong>: The warband can have up to two</p>
<p>Plague Knights known as the Lamenters.</p>
<p>; <strong>The Fallen</strong>: The warband cannot include a Lord</p>
<p>of Tumours or Amalgam, for all were slain a long</p>
<p>time ago.</p>
<p>; <strong>The Lost</strong>: The warband may only have a</p>
<p>maximum of two Hounds (known as Wailers) and a maximum of two Heralds
of Beelzebub (called</p>
<p>Weepers).</p>
<p>; <strong>The Bereaved</strong>: The Grail Thralls and Fly
Thralls</p>
<p>of the warband are called the Bereaved. Grail Thralls (but not Fly
Thralls) can use ranged weapons, standards and musical instruments from
the Black Grail Armoury. They have a Ranged characteristic of</p>
<p><em>+0 DICE </em>and cost 35 ducats each.</p>
<p>; <strong>Dishonoured</strong>: No model in the warband may</p>
<p>carry the Black Grail Shield or Beelzebub’s Axe. The Lord of the
Flies does not suffer failed knights to</p>
<p>carry his device.</p>
<p>; <strong>Hegemon’s Last Blessing</strong>: This warband has</p>
<p>Plague Blade <em>LIMIT:3</em>, Putrid Shotgun <em>LIMIT:3 </em>and
Viscera Cannon <em>LIMIT:2</em>. Non-<em>ELITE </em>models can be
equipped with Viscera Cannons.</p>
<p class="heading" id="hegemons-will">Hegemon’s Will</p>
<p>Using the remnants of the lingering power of a fallen Hegemon, any
Plague Knight in the warband can command any Thrall within 18” of it
directly. During its Activation, a Plague Knight can remove an
<em>INFECTION MARKER </em>from any model in play to enable a Thrall
within 18” to use any one of the Actions detailed</p>
<p>below. Each Thrall can only be affected by Hegemon’s Will once per
Turn, but one Plague Knight may issue commands to multiple Thralls
(though not multiple times to the same Thrall) during a single
Activation, if all the conditions are met.</p>
<p>; <strong>Move</strong>: The Thrall makes the standard Move
Action.</p>
<p>; <strong>Ranged Attack</strong>: The Thrall performs a Ranged</p>
<p>Attack <em>ACTION </em>with any Ranged weapon it has.</p>
<p>; <strong>Charge</strong>: The Thrall makes a standard Charge</p>
<p>Action.</p>
<p>; <strong>Melee Attack</strong>: The Thrall performs a Melee</p>
<p>Attack <em>ACTION</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong>: In the beginning of the Activation of the
model wearing the Crown, it causes one <em>INFECTION MARKER </em>on each
enemy model in melee combat with it. Despite its name, this item is not

the Urn and any other models fully with 3” suffer a <em>-1 DICE

<h2 id="the-court-of-the-seven-headed-serpent">The Court of the
Seven-Headed Serpent</h2>
<p>J</p>
<p>utting from eternally belching plumes of stinking, corrosive smoke is
the Iron City</p>
<p>of Dis; and atop its shrieking, black keep can be found the Infernal
War Council. There sits seven of the greatest, most wicked and cunning
of Arch-Devils, each representing</p>
<p>one of the Seven Mortal Sins made manifest. They are the rulers of
the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent which oversees Hell’s war against
Creation on Earth. Each is known as one of the Heads of the Serpent, and
ultimately it is their commands that dictate all the military forces of
the Great War in the service of the infernal hierarchy.</p>
<p>In this twisted, treacherous and ever-shifting political arena, even
the mightiest of Devils rarely sit at the great War Council for long.
Towering statues of the Serpent Heads representing Wrath, Envy, Pride,
Gluttony, Greed, Sloth and Lust are erected in Dis by slavering work
gangs of yoke fiends, only to be torn down again and crushed into rubble
as new Devil Lords rise to the pinnacle of power by trampling over their
rivals.</p>
<p>The hierarchy of the Court is anything but stable: only Mammon is
said to have held the position of the Serpent Head of Greed almost
without break for the duration</p>
<p>of the entire Great War. Other positions have seen a bewildering
parade of dukes, marquises, margraves, barons and baronesses,
paramounts, princes, lords, ladies, earls and myriad other high nobles
that make up the infernal hierarchy. This whirlwind of political glory,
followed by utter ruin, is reflected as shifts of power amongst their
mortal followers on earth. The Council operates on majority vote and
often with the thinnest of margins. It takes very little for an
ambitious prince or princess of Hell to make so many enemies that they
are</p>
<p>deposed and their wings torn, forced them to begin their ascent from
the bottom once more, with the mockery of their rivals burning them like
venom.</p>
<p>Countless envious pretenders work against the Heads of</p>
<p>the Serpent, seeking to replace them and gain the glory and prestige
that comes with such a lofty position. The might of the demons also
waxes and wanes based on how many mortal followers they can corrupt to
their cause, and thus there is a constant change in which demon lords
can don one of the seven serpent-headed crowns.</p>
<p>While Beelzebub is the most powerful Devil of Gluttony by far, the
Lord of the Flies scorns his rightful place at the Court, waging his
battle against creation through his Black Grail instead. This leaves his
seat open so the lesser fallen angels can struggle for the honour of
sitting on the Hungry Throne.</p>
<p>Upon the commands of the Court, the warbands of Hell gather at the
Hellgate and strike out to blight our unhappy world. Yoke fiends muster
under the banners of their praetors and sorcerers. The shattered forms
of the Hell Knights are forced into their suits of armour, emerging from
their fiery tombs where their bodies are kept crushed under mighty,
ever-turning slabs of</p>
<p>black basalt while they are not serving in the war effort. Desecrated
Saints are brought forth to act as unholy war altars that pollute and
pervert the land which they travel over. Ahead of the warbands fly Pit
Locusts, the clatter of their wings heralding the coming of the Court,
their poison stings leaving burns that cannot be healed. And sometimes,
when the deathly omens in Hell’s burning sky and black stars are
favourable, a Hunter of the Left- hand Path will join a warband as they
strike out from the Mouth of Hell. As the warband marches to join</p>
<p>the Great War, joyous and triumphant music played by unseen hands can
be heard at these times, for taking part in one of these hunts is seen
as a great privilege within the Sheol.</p>
<p>Before most warbands, the whips of the yoke fiends drive living human
slave soldiers of the Court known as the wretched. These unfortunate
souls possess not a drop of demon blood. They act as disposable shock
troops or are used as subjects of torture to power the Goetic magic
of</p>

<p>the sorcerers and other users of the dark arts. Captured during one
of the hunts of the Court, sold to the devils in the heretic domains or
having the misfortune to have foolishly pushed through in the places
where the borders of the world are thin, their minds are scarred by
witnessing the horror of damnation while still alive. Willing to do
anything to escape their fate a million times worse than death, they
grasp at the thinnest of</p>
<p>straws. Should a wretch bring down a mighty opponent, the Law of Hell
is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom, in memory and honour of the
First Rebellion when there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels
painted the firmament red.</p>
<h6 id="the-court-and-the-great-war">The Court and the Great War</h6>
<p>When the Gate of Hell was opened by the Ultimate Heresy of the
Templars, it was the warbands of the Court that poured out and took the
Levant by the storm, long before the first Heretic Legion was ever
formed. They fell upon the people of the Middle East, Asia and Europa.
They crushed the mortal armies sent against them like fire burning dry
chaff. Only at Antioch and at the Iron Wall were they eventually
checked, though at a terrible cost. Meanwhile, awed even by these least
of Hell’s servants, countless men and women fell</p>
<p>to their knees at the sight of the dark splendour of the Court and
worshipped them as gods. Those with truly wicked hearts were spared and
they became the first heretics. Eventually their numbers would swell
into the millions who now fill the teeming cities and domains under the
shadow of the Hellgate.</p>
<p>Being both of the material world and of the world of spirit, the
Court’s foot soldiers can march to make war on Earth without a fear of
divine retribution as they do not break the Covenant of Hell. The Court
also carefully limits the size of these warbands, so that most of the
suffering and dying of the Great War is done by mortals, both to spite
the God-Tyrant YHWH, but also to enhance their own power, as more humans
are corrupted and die in the rebellion, the more God’s plan is disturbed
and the greater the power of the devils waxes.</p>
<p>The missions of the Court against the Faithful do not follow the same
logic as one a mortal commander might have. A mighty praetor could
strike at a militarily insignificant village only to kill a new-born
future saint, betray their own mortal followers by suddenly falling</p>
<p>upon some unsuspecting heretic settlement or even clash with a
warband of a rival Head of the Serpent. The wise do not question the
motives of Hell’s rage and Heretics accept these occasional attacks
against their forces as</p>
<p>a fitting judgement for their lack of success in the war against the
Faithful.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong>: When this model ends its Activation, each

effect or ability that negates <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>from the Keyword
<em>FIRE </em>negates this <em>BLOOD MARKER</em>.</p>
<h6 id="infernal-iron-armour">Infernal Iron Armour</h6>
<p><em>This armour is forged simultaneously in Hell and on Earth, so

Hell Knights that are forced to wear it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Injuries against this model are rolled with a
flat -2 penalty. This penalty applies against injuries that ignore
armour.</p>
<h3 id="goetic-powers"><u>Goetic Powers</u></h3>
<p>Many of the warriors of the Court have access to Goetic spells –
abilities and powers which use the suffering of mortals as spiritual
energy to unleash the reality-bending powers of the Demons. As God’s
plan for the universe is disrupted and perverted, the infernal sorcerers
and other demonic creatures can use the released primordial energy of
Creation to alter reality. Demons have to be quick, however: God’s
omnipotence will soon reassert itself and the opportunity for Demons to
disturb the world is lost. Thus infernal creatures have a continuous and
growing need for human sacrifices, pain and endless warfare to enable
their supernatural powers.</p>
<p>Goetic Powers are marked with the keyword <em>GOETIC (x) </em>where
the number in brackets indicates how many <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>will
have to be spent to trigger the effect of the spell. If multiple numbers
or a range of numbers are listed in the brackets, any one of those
numbers can be chosen. These <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>can be taken from
any model currently taking part in the battle, be they friendly or enemy
models. However, they must come from models that do not have the Keyword
<em>DEMONIC </em>or <em>BLACK GRAIL</em>.</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>used this way are removed from the game and
the described effect of the Goetic Spell or ability then takes effect as
described – no <em>ACTION </em>roll is needed. As with other
<em>ACTIONS</em>, each of these powers and spells can be used by the
model only once per Activation. Some Goetic Powers are not marked with
the Keyword <em>GOETIC</em></p>
<p><em>(x)</em>. These powers are typically passive abilities.</p>
<h6 id="goetic-powers-spells">Goetic Powers &amp; Spells</h6>
<p>Many of the warriors of the Court have access to a selection of
devastating spells and other powers as detailed in the list below which
can be purchased at the indicated cost when the model is initially
purchased. Depending on the type of model and which Deadly Sin the
warband is dedicated to, the selection available to you may vary. All
such limitations are clearly marked below.</p>
<h3 id="any-warband"><u>Any Warband</u></h3>
<h6 id="burning-inferno-15-ducats">Burning Inferno 15 ducats</h6>
<p>Using this <em>GOETIC (1-3) </em>spell the Sorcerer opens a portal to
the Lake of Fire and draws forth a great screaming ball of infernal lava
mixed with damned souls. Select a 1x1mm point within 36” that the
Sorcerer can see. Next, take a ranged attack <em>ACTION</em>: this
attack suffers penalties for range but not for Cover. If the roll fails
(i.e. you roll 6 or less), the fireball lands 1” away from its intended
location, multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure
(for example, if you rolled 5, the fireball lands 2” away, as 7-5=2).
The direction is decided by your opponent. For each <em>BLOOD MARKER
</em>used, the Burning Inferno adds +1” <em>BLAST </em>to the attack.
Additionally, if the Burning Inferno lands directly on top of a model,
it ignores that model’s armour. This attack has the Keyword
<em>FIRE</em>.</p>

<h6 id="charge-of-hatred-10-ducats">Charge of Hatred 10 ducats</h6>

<p>This model can be equipped with one weapon or suit of armour
(excluding shields) from the Trench Pilgrim, New Antioch or Iron
Sultanate warband armouries, including ranged weapons. You must pay the
cost of this item as standard and, if it is lost, it must be purchased
again as soon as you have the funds. This item follows the normal
limitations. The model will never willingly trade this item away or
allow it to be removed.</p>
<p>Praetor or Sorcerer only, Envy Warband only</p>
<h6 id="coveted-position-10-ducats">Coveted Position 10 ducats</h6>

<h6 id="what-is-yours-is-mine-10-ducats">What is Yours is Mine 10

<p>Using this <em>GOETIC (1) </em>spell allows the model with this power
to take one <em>BLOOD </em>or <em>BLESSING MARKER </em>from any model on
the battlefield that it can see, removing it from the target and gaining
that kind of marker for itself. This can even come from a model with a
Keyword <em>BLACK GRAIL </em>or <em>DEMONIC</em>. The cost of the spell
must still be paid as normal and it is separate from the <em>MARKER
</em>it moves.</p>

two).</p>
<p><em>ELITE </em>only, Lust Warband only.</p>
<h6 id="call-of-flesh-15-ducats">Call of Flesh 15 ducats</h6>
<p>Using this <em>GOETIC (2) </em>spell ends the activation of the model
using it. The model the enemy activates next this turn must take its
move as its first <em>ACTION </em>and move as directly towards the user
of this power as it can through any passable terrain, including
dangerous terrain, jumping down etc, taking applicable damage on the
way. It can then act normally but cannot target the user of this spell
during this Activation with ranged or melee attacks.</p>

<p><em>ELITE </em>only, Pride Warband only</p>
<h6 id="too-proud-to-fall-10-ducats">Too Proud to Fall 10 ducats</h6>
<p>Using this <em>GOETIC (2) </em>spell allows the model to negate a
Down state or ignore any injury (though not the <em>BLOODF MARKER</em>),
attack or power that would have caused the model to fall Down. Note that
if a <em>TOUGH </em>model suffers an Out of Action result, which is then
converted into Down, this power can be used, but the <em>TOUGH
</em>ability is considered to have been used.</p>
<p>Praetor or Sorcerer Only, Pride Warband only</p>
<h6 id="light-of-the-morning-star-15-ducats">Light of the Morning Star
15 ducats</h6>
<p>Using this <em>GOETIC (2) </em>spell hits any enemy the model sees
within 24”. The target must immediately roll on the Injury Chart. If
this does not take it Out of Action, the target is pushed back 1D6”
directly away from the user of this power if it is on a 32mm or smaller
base. If they hit another model or a solid object, they stop. They also
stop if they would enter Impassable Terrain or if they would be pushed
out of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Praetor or Sorcerer Only, Pride Warband only</p>
<h3 id="sloth"><u>Sloth</u></h3>
<h6 id="morphean-mind-5-ducats">Morphean Mind 5 ducats</h6>
<p><em>The mind of this Demonic creature warps the flow of time so it
can take as long as it wishes to decide on its actions.</em></p>
<p>When this model takes an <em>ACTION</em>, or its attack causes an
Injury Roll, it can choose to wait until after the roll is made to
modify it with <em>MARKERS </em>(<em>BLOOD </em>or <em>BLESSING</em>).
If it chooses to do so, the opponent commits whether or not they will
apply <em>MARKERS </em>and how many. After seeing the result of the
roll, the model may choose to apply <em>MARKERS </em>if it wishes,
including to trigger <em>BLOODBATH</em>. Roll additional dice and modify
the result.</p>
<p>Praetor or Sorcerer Only, Sloth Warband only</p>
<h6 id="charm-of-acedia-10-ducats">Charm of Acedia 10 ducats</h6>
<p><em>The great aversion to effort possessed by this infernal warrior
seeps to nearby creatures or to the very Creation itself, forcing them
to bend to its will and thus avoiding the need for the demonic creature
to struggle to achieve its aims.</em></p>
<p>This <em>GOETIC (1) </em>spell can be cast right before the model
casting it takes an <em>ACTION </em>involving any model, friend or foe
(including the model itself and thus covering Dashing, Climbing, Jumping
etc). The target ceases any potential resistance or tension, seeing no
point in such effort, making the <em>ACTION </em>succeed automatically
with no dice rolled.</p>

<p>This <em>GOETIC (2) </em>spell can be cast at any enemy model that
has not yet been Activated in the battle at all. Pick any one equipment
item (i.e. not weapon or armour) the model is carrying. This item is

arms, others multiple heads or countless alterations and terrible

echo of their angelic past – but instead float across No Man’s Land,
chanting the cruel gospel of Hell as they advance. Their dark wisdom and

Lethe as its ranged weapon and it cannot swap or lose this weapon. It
always takes the use of one of the arms of the Hunter.</p>
<p class="heading" id="abilities-40">Abilities</p>
<p>; <strong>Shadow Walker</strong>: Using <em>GOETIC (1)</em>, the
Hunter can retreat from melee combat without any of its opponents
getting the chance to make attacks against it.</p>
<p>; <strong>Left-Hand Path</strong>: Once per Activation, as part of
any single movement that the</p>
<p>Hunter takes during its Activation (Standard Move, Retreat, Charge,
Dash etc.), it can use a <em>GOETIC (1) </em>power to walk the path
between Hell and Creation. The Hunter must be touching a piece of
terrain when it uses this power. When it does, it is immediately placed
in contact with any other piece of terrain on</p>
<p>the battlefield, including on top of or inside terrain, if legal
positions exist. Its movement then continues as normal. All usual
movement rules persist for this movement (moving into or out of Melee
Combat, for example).</p>
<p>The Hunter can do this multiple times during its chosen move, though
it has to pay the <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>cost for each such jump between
terrain pieces. If the Hunter uses this ability during a Charge, it does
not need to take the most direct route possible toward its target, but
it still selects its target as normal (i.e. it can see the</p>
<p>target when declaring a Charge).</p>
<p>; <strong>Oracle Beast Cloak</strong>: Once per turn, the Hunter can
use this <em>GOETIC (3)</em></p>
<p>after an injury is rolled against it to negate the result (and any
other effects caused by the triggering event) entirely. Effects from the
triggering event, such as <em>BLAST </em>weapons that originally
targeted the Hunter, still affect other models as normal.</p>

a Minor Hit instead (note that the <em>TOUGH </em>Keyword ability to
avoid Out of Action with Down overrides this). Due to its bulk the
wearer rolls D3 for a charge extra distance instead of D6. Machine

this item to grant a rifle <strong>or </strong>pistol weapon that they
are equipped with the <em>FIRE </em>keyword until the end of the battle.
Keywords: <em>FIRE</em>, <em>CONSUMABLE</em>.</p>
<h6 id="tracer-bullets">Tracer Bullets</h6>
<p><em>Tracer bullets allow soldiers to adjust their aim
efficiently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Before the battle begins, a model may use
this item to grant a rifle <strong>or </strong>pistol weapon that they
are equipped with +1D to hit with ranged attacks until the end of the
battle. Keywords: <em>CONSUMABLE</em>.</p>
<h6 id="sniper-scope">Sniper Scope</h6>
<p><em>These optical aiming devices are favoured by Snipers to aid in
their aiming at long distances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Negates the penalty for Long Range if the
model has not moved during this Activation. Only usable with rifles
(i.e. weapons which have the Keyword rifle in their name).</p>
<h6 id="shovel">Shovel</h6>
<p><em>Battlefield shovel allows troops to dig in and fight from cover
in virtually any battlefield.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: A model equipped with a shovel always starts
the game in cover if deployed on ground level, even if placed in open
terrain. As soon as the model moves, it is no longer in cover. A model
that is covered in this way retains the benefit of Cover even if the
attacking model has an unobstructed view of it. If a model equipped with
a shovel has two hands free, it can use it in Melee Combat as if it were
a Trench Club.</p>
<h6 id="troop-flag">Troop Flag</h6>
<p><em>Most warbands and units carry banners, flags, standards, pennants
or other symbols to rally the troops.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Grants +1 <em>DICE </em>for all Morale tests
as long as the model with the flag is not Down or Out of Action.
Requires one hand to use.</p>
<h6 id="martyrdom-pills">Martyrdom Pills</h6>
<p><em>Martyrdom pills are a potent mixture of mind-altering drugs and
chemicals that inure a soldier against all pain and injury. However, it
takes a tremendous toll on the body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Before the battle begins, a model may use
this item. If it does, injuries rolled against it suffer <em>-1 DICE
</em>until the end of the battle and the model is not affected by
<em>FEAR</em>. Keywords: <em>CONSUMABLE</em>.</p>
<h6 id="unholy-trinket">Unholy Trinket</h6>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: When a model equipped with an Unholy Trinket
fails a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>, that model may use this item. If it does,
its Activation is not ended. Keyword: <em>CONSUMABLE</em>.</p>
<h6 id="unholy-relic">Unholy Relic</h6>
<p><em>An artefact bestowed with unholy power. Examples include Nephilim
heads, desecrated splinters of the True Cross or mummified body parts of
fallen saints and bishops.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: A model equipped with an Unholy relic
radiates a truly malignant aura and causes <em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<h6 id="blessed-icon">Blessed Icon</h6>
<p><em>Small icons of saints, great angels and holy warriors are a
common sight amongst the Trench Pilgrims. They are hung on rosaries,
belts, or attached to portable shrines carried on the Pilgrims’
backs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: When a model equipped with a Blessed Icon
fails a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>, that model may use this item. If it does,
its Activation is not ended. Can be used once per battle.</p>
<h6 id="infernal-brand-mark">Infernal Brand Mark</h6>

<p><em>Holy reliquaries, blessed artefacts and sacred crosses are often
carried to the battlefield to encourage the troops, while the Heretics
bring idols of the Golden Calf, tortured captives or other wicked totems
to bear.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Can be placed on the battlefield in your
deployment zone. Acts as three models for Morale Tests. It has a base
size of 40mm. Can be destroyed if any type of attack hits it.</p>
<h6 id="hellbound-soul-contract">Hellbound Soul Contract</h6>
<p><em>An infernal contract signed by a Heretic and the devil who will
come to collect the damned soul when death is close. The mortal
signatory bursts into infernal flames when seriously wounded.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: When this model is taken Out of Action, any
model in melee combat with them immediately suffers +1</p>
<p><em>BLOOD MARKER </em>unless the model ignores damage from sources
with the Keyword <em>FIRE</em>.</p>
<h6 id="binoculars">Binoculars</h6>
<p><em>It is quite common for officers to carry finely-crafted
battlefield binoculars with them on the battlefield to survey the land
ahead, spot hidden enemy troops and observe any sign of
movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Any enemy Infiltrator cannot be placed closer
than 16” of this model.</p>
<h6 id="musical-instrument">Musical Instrument</h6>
<p><em>Horns, drums, trumpets, whistles, bagpipes and many other types
of instruments are used extensively in the battles of the Great War.
They can bolster the hearts of those facing the horrors of Hell – or
they can recite terrifying hymns praising the lords of the
Inferno!</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Any friendly models within 4” of the musician
who is not Down can add <em>+1 DICE </em>to their Dash <em>ACTIONS</em>.
Musical Instruments take one hand to use at all times as if it were a
weapon.</p>

<h3 id="table-size"><u>Table Size</u></h3>
<p>Battles are fought on a table with 4’ x 4’ dimensions. The scenario
will always indicate clearly if the table size differs from this.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-terrain"><u>Setting up Terrain</u></h3>
<p>Unless the Scenario states otherwise, use the following rules to set
up the scenarios. The player with the lower number of models in their
force can place one of the following terrain pieces on the table:</p>
<p>; One Building (a tower, house etc.)</p>
<p>; One Piece of Dangerous Terrain (swamp, barbed</p>
<p>wire etc.)</p>
<p>; One Piece of Difficult Terrain (forest, rocky</p>
<p>ground)</p>
<p>; One Piece of Impassable terrain (12” river with a</p>
<p>bridge or ford, sheer cliffs etc.) Maximum two pieces</p>
<p>per battle</p>
<p>; One Hill</p>
<p>; One Fence/Wall/other defendable terrain piece</p>
<p>(max one per player)</p>
<p>; 6” Section of a Trench</p>
<p>Each building must be placed:</p>
<p>; at least 8” away from any table edge and</p>
<p>; at least 6” away from the nearest building</p>
<p>Both players place these large terrain pieces until they have both
placed at least three pieces each. In addition, both players should add
six smaller terrain pieces like boxes, sandbags, bomb craters, wells,
fountains etc. anywhere on the table to create additional cover.</p>
<h3 id="objective-markers"><u>Objective Markers</u></h3>
<p>Some Scenarios use <strong>Objective Markers</strong>. You can use
flags, coins, banners, beads or other suitable pieces for these
markers.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-battle-and"><u>Before the Battle and</u></h3>
<p><u>Pre-Battle Abilities</u></p>
<p>Many abilities instruct (or offer) the chance to take an action
before the battle begins. These are called</p>
<p>Pre-Battle Abilities. Unless otherwise stated, Pre-Battle Abilities
are activated and resolved after forces have been assembled and the
terrain has been set up, but before models have been deployed.</p>
<p>If both players have Pre-Battle Abilities to resolve at the same
time, each player resolves a single Pre-Battle Ability at a time in
alternating order, starting with the player who will have the first
turn. If multiple Pre-</p>
<p>Battle Abilities belonging to the same player need to be resolved at
the same time, the player that they belong to may resolve them in any
order that they please (unless the abilities specify that they must be
activated in a specific order). If one player has resolved all of
their</p>
<p>Pre-Battle Abilities, the other player may resolve the remainder of
theirs.</p>
<h3 id="victory-points"><u>Victory Points</u></h3>
<p><strong>Victory Points </strong>(VPs) are used to determine who wins
and loses a battle in most scenarios. VPs are often awarded for
objectives specific to the scenario you are playing and this is clearly
explained in the scenario itself.</p>
<p>If you are playing the Campaign, the winner always gains 5 VPs if
otherwise the result would indicate less.</p>
<h3 id="duration-of-the-game"><u>Duration of the Game</u></h3>
<p>A typical game lasts for six Game Turns. Some scenarios have a
different duration. These cases are always clearly indicated in the
rules for the scenario.</p>

<h3 id="the-battlefield"><u>The Battlefield</u></h3>
<p>The game is played on a standard-sized battlefield (we suggest 4’ x
4’).</p>
<p>The Table must contain five buildings such as ruined houses, bunkers,
chapels etc. At least part of each building must be in the location
indicated on the map with a Red Marker. These buildings are the

opponent’s.</p>
<p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at a time,
starting with the player who has more models in their warband (roll-off
if both have the same number of models).</p>
<p>Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. If a
player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their
models afterwards. Once the players have set up their models, deployment
ends and the battle begins.</p>
<h3 id="battle-length"><u>Battle Length</u></h3>
<p>The battle lasts for four turns.</p>
<h3 id="victory-conditions"><u>Victory Conditions</u></h3>
<p>Keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides. The players
accumulate VPs as follows:</p>
<p>; At the end of each turn, a player scores one VP for each Objective
building that they have a model within 1” of or two VPs for each
Objective building</p>
<p>that they control.</p>
<p>; A player controls an Objective if the total</p>
<p>number of models from their warband that are wholly within that
building is higher than the total number of enemy models within 1” of
the Objective building. A model is considered wholly within</p>
<p>a building if it is entirely within the edges of the</p>
<p>building’s footprint, as agreed by the players.</p>
<p>; Calculate VPs for both players and the end of the</p>
<p>round and add them together. The player with the higher number of VPs
wins, otherwise the game is a draw.</p>
<h3 id="glorious-deeds"><u>Glorious Deeds</u></h3>
<p>Players score one Glory Point for every model that completes any of
the following Glorious Deeds. Victory Points for these can only be
gained once – whichever player completes them first gets the Glory!</p>
<p>; <strong>Sniper</strong>: Take out an enemy <em>ELITE </em>in Cover
with a shooting attack at Long Range.</p>
<p>; <strong>Lord of War</strong>: Take two or more enemy models</p>
<p>Out of Action in a single turn with melee attacks</p>
<p>with one of your own models.</p>
<p>; <strong>Cast them Down</strong>: Make an enemy fall from</p>
<p>a height of 3” or more thanks to your action</p>
<p>(shooting, melee, Supernatural Power etc.).</p>
<p>; <strong>Bloodletting</strong>: Make one of your enemies suffer</p>

separately for Victory Points (see below).</p>
<p>Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual way.</p>
<p><u>Mines</u></p>
<p>The Defender then places 12 mine markers on the battlefield, four
which will be duds – the defender marks</p>
<p>the duds on the side of the marker that is hidden from view (face
down). The Defender can place the mines anywhere within the battlefield
up to 12” away from their own Deployment Zone as shown, though not
inside their own deployment zone. When any model comes within 2” of the
centre of a mine counter (players can measure this distance beforehand),
flip the counter over to see if it is a dud or not. If the mine is a
dud, discard it immediately. If the mine is not a dud, every model
within 3” must immediately roll on the Injury Chart to see what happens
as a result of the exploding mine. The mines have the Keyword
<em>SHRAPNEL</em>, so</p>
<p>the models hit by the mine blast suffer an additional <em>BLOOD
MARKER </em>unless they have protection against this. Afterwards, remove
the mine marker. It is possible to trigger more than one mine at the

<p>Some models, such as New Antioch Combat Engineers can remove a mine
counter by moving in base contact with it and passing a <em>RISKY ACTION

attempts this, the mine does not explode until the result of the roll is
determined.</p>

<p>If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their Morale test,
the game ends and the opposing warband wins.</p>
<p>Otherwise, keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides. The
players accumulate VPs as follows:</p>
<p>; At the end of the battle, the defender scores 2 victory points for
each trench section that has one of the defender’s models and no enemies
in it. The</p>
<p>defender scores 1 VP for each trench section that has</p>
<p>one of their models, but also has one or more enemy models.</p>
<p>; At the end of the battle, the Attacker scores 2</p>
<p>VPs for each trench section that has one or more of their models, but
also has one or more enemy</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>; At the end of the battle the Attacker scores 3 VPs</p>
<p>for each trench section that has one or more of their models but no
enemy models. Calculate VPs at the end each turn for both players and
the end of the game and add them together. The player with the higher
number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is</p>
<p>a draw.</p>
<h3 id="glorious-deeds-3"><u>Glorious Deeds</u></h3>

<h3 id="overview"><u>Overview</u></h3>
<p>An armoured train has been derailed. While no clear reason has been
determined, some speculate that this ill-fated transport could have been
sent by loyal citizens desperate to support their forces in the front
lines.</p>
<p>Others say that it was part of a military effort that was ambushed by
enemy forces, or that it could have been contraband intended as a
commercial venture by merchants seeking to profit from the demands of
war. Truth be told, any other misfortune might have fallen upon it. What
truly matters is that the train carried</p>
<p>supplies vital to keep the engines of war up and running: food,
ammunition, medicine and even relics—holy and unholy. The loss of its
contents has sparked a frenzy</p>
<p>and now warbands from all sides rush to claim what remains. Evidence
of a brutal fate lies scattered across the landscape, with barbed wire,
scattered shells and fading blood trails hinting at a crew that vanished
without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="forces-6"><u>Forces</u></h3>
<p>Both forces can use up to 15 models from their warband.</p>
<h3 id="the-battlefield-6"><u>The Battlefield</u></h3>
<p>The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we suggest 4’ x
4’). The table must contain:</p>
<p>; A hill spanning its entire middle section, as indicated on the
map</p>
<p>; A bridge dividing the hill in half, forming a</p>
<p>tunnel that allows access to both sides of the map</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>; A train with three wagons spread throughout the</p>
<p>highest section of the hill.</p>
<p>Both the hill and the bridge should be about 5” high. Models up to
125mm tall can pass under the bridge. Parts of each side of the hill
must contain patches of barbed wire. The hill sides should also be
considered as Difficult Terrain, due to the steep elevation.</p>
<p>Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual way, using
models such as guard towers, ruined buildings etc., placing them at
least 1” away from the hillsides.</p>
<h3 id="infiltrators-5"><u>Infiltrators</u></h3>
<p>Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but must be deployed as
normal troops.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-5"><u>Deployment</u></h3>
<p>The players roll-off. The winner of the roll-off chooses which
deployment zone will be theirs. The other deployment zone will be their
opponent’s.</p>
<p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at a time,
starting with the player who has more models in their warband (roll-off
if both have the same number of models).</p>
<p>Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. If a
player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their
models afterwards. Once the players have set up their models, deployment
ends and the battle begins.</p>
<p>Then place a Gun Turret model, represented by a circled G, on top of
the wagon at the centre of the map. Once placed, neither of these can be
moved during the game. See the Field Artillery rules for the weapons’
profile and specifications.</p>
<h3 id="battle-length-5"><u>Battle Length</u></h3>
<p>The battle lasts for six turns.</p>
<h3 id="train-wagons"><u>Train Wagons</u></h3>
<p>The derailed train has three wagons. Each wagon is 4” wide (W), 8”
long (L) and 5” high (H). The wagons have a set of ladders on both
sides, allowing models to climb on top of a wagon as part of their
standard Move. A wagon also provides cover to a model that is in base
contact with it.</p>
<p>The train was carrying supply crates, containing precious weapons,
materials and holy relics. The supply crates are spread between the
three wagons.</p>
<p>Place three initial markers representing Objectives on the table as
indicated on the map. These markers</p>
<p>represent an X quantity of supply crates inside a wagon. The wagons
are all closed, making it impossible to see the contents inside.</p>
<p>A wagon can be opened from either side by a model within 1”. The
model must roll on the Action Success Chart to force open a wagon’s
door. <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>and <em>BLESSING MARKERS </em>can be used
to hinder, or aid, this Action.</p>
<p>Upon opening a wagon, the player must then roll a D3:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>- </strong>There is one supply crate inside the wagon:</li>
</ol>
<p>Place one Objective Marker beside the model who opened the wagon to
represent the crate and remove the previous marker from the table</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>- </strong>There are two supply crates inside the wagon:
Place two Objective Markers beside the model who opened the wagon to
represent the crates and remove the previous marker from the
table</p></li>
<li><p><strong>- </strong>There are three supply crates inside the
wagon: Place three Objective Markers beside the model who opened the
wagon to represent the crates and remove the previous marker from the
table.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="supply-crates"><u>Supply Crates</u></h3>
<p>During the game, any model that ends its move in contact with a
marker can Claim it, without the need for a roll, as long as they’re not
engaged in melee combat.</p>
<p>The model has then Claimed a crate. A model can end a Claim without
the need for a roll at the start of the model’s Activation, dropping the
crate within 1” of the model, in a direction of the model’s choice. The
same</p>
<p>model cannot make a new Claim during that Activation. A model can
only Claim one crate at a time and must immediately choose one of the
three following options:</p>
<p>; <strong>Extract Supplies</strong>: The model picks up the crate to
start extracting it, without the need for a roll. The crates are
<em>HEAVY </em>and must be held with all hands a model may have. Any
weapons a model might be carrying, or is integrated with, will be
rendered unusable while the model is extracting the crate. As long as a
model is extracting the crate, it cannot Attack, cannot Dash and any
other method of movement (teleportation, Puppet Master etc.) cannot be
used to move the model due to the mystical effect of the holy relics
inside, other than</p>
<p>their standard Move.</p>
<p>At the end of its Activation, the model can <strong>pass the crate
</strong>it is extracting to any friendly model within 1” range, as long
as neither model is in melee combat with an enemy model. The model
receiving the crate is considered to have ended their Activation this
turn, if it has not yet done so. A model extracting</p>
<p>a crate can drop it without the need for a roll or be forced to drop
it if engaged in melee combat, dropping the crate within 1” of the model
in a direction of the model owner’s choice.</p>
<p>A model can also change its choice to <strong>Destroy Supplies
</strong>(see below) without the need for a roll at any point. If a
model extracting a crate moves into</p>
<p>contact with any table edge, it has escaped with the crate
successfully and does not return to the table, in which case remove the
Objective Marker representing the extracted supplies from the table and
the model that extracted it.</p>
<p>; <strong>Destroy Supplies</strong>: The model that has Claimed</p>
<p>a crate, or that is extracting it, can attack it as an
<em>ACTION</em>. If successful, the crate is destroyed, in which case
remove the Objective Marker</p>
<p>representing the destroyed supplies from the table.</p>
<p>; <strong>Use Supplies</strong>: As an <em>ACTION</em>, a model
that</p>
<p>has Claimed a crate can attempt to open it and use the relics inside.
If successful, gain a <em>BLESSING MARKER</em>, in which case remove the
Objective Marker representing the used crate from the table.</p>
<p>An enemy model cannot attack a crate that has been Claimed, or that
is being extracted by another model, but they can attack the model
normally.</p>
<p>If the model that has Claimed a crate, or is extracting it, is taken
Out of Action, the crate is immediately dropped within 3” of the fallen
model, in a direction of the enemy’s choice. If it lands in contact with
another model, the model can immediately Claim it, except if they’re
engaged in melee combat with an enemy model, in which case the crate
must be dropped again in a different direction.</p>
<p>If the game ends while a model has a Claimed crate, or is in the
process of extracting it, they have failed to either extract it, destroy
it or use it, and so it does not count towards the final VPs
calculation.</p>
<h3 id="victory-conditions-6"><u>Victory Conditions</u></h3>
<p>If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their Morale test,
the game ends and the opposing warband wins. Otherwise, keep a running
tally of Victory Points for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as
follows:</p>
<p>; A player scores 3 VPs for each crate successfully extracted from
the map.</p>
<p>; A player scores 2 VPs for each crate destroyed</p>
<p>during the game.</p>
<p>; A player scores 1 VPs for each crate used during</p>

<h3 id="overview-1"><u>Overview</u></h3>
<p>The shoreline of this beach, river, lake or swamp stands as a vital
stronghold - its bunkers, trenches and heavy emplacements forming an
unyielding wall against invasion. Guarding a crucial supply route, the
defenders rely on their fortifications and firepower to hold the line
with minimal troops, confident in the terrain’s advantage. Yet, the
attackers have taken note</p>
<p>of the thinly stretched defences, massing their forces in
overwhelming numbers to breach the coastal bastion. The horizon brims
with movement, the tide of war rolling in to test the strength of the
shoreline’s iron grip.</p>
<h3 id="forces-7"><u>Forces</u></h3>
<p>The player with the higher number of models is the Attacker. The
Attacker must declare the size of their warband, up to sixteen models
max. If the Attacker has two or fewer <em>ELITES</em>, they must field
all of them. The opponent is the Defender and they can have up to half
of the total number of models the Attacker has declared, rounded down.
If both warbands have the same number of models, roll a dice to see who
the Attacker and who the Defender is.</p>
<h3 id="the-battlefield-7"><u>The Battlefield</u></h3>
<p>The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we suggest 4’ x
4’).</p>
<p>The Defender places three 8”-long Trench sections in their Deployment
Zone. They can be placed as the</p>
<p>Defender wishes and can be continuous. However, in the division
between each of the three trench sections the Defender must place a
bunker model (as indicated by the small Red Markers on the map) of at
least 4” x 4” and up to 3” high, so that models of up to 75mm tall may
enter the bunker’s interior.</p>
<p>The Defender must place a Main Structure in the location indicated on
the map by a large Red Marker. This structure can be a church, a large
bunker, a tower etc. It must be at least 6” x 6” and up to 6” high, so
that models of up to 150mm tall may enter the building’s interior.</p>
<p>The Main Structure and the bunkers are the Objectives of the
scenario, hereafter referred to as Objective Buildings, and score
Victory Points (VPs).</p>
<p>The Defender then places three defence works (sandbags, barricades,
low wall etc.) each of which counts as a defended obstacle and is at
least 4” long</p>
<p>horizontally. They are max 1” high. Use the following instructions to
deploy these defence works.</p>
<p>; Within 18” of the centre of the battlefield (measured to the
centre).</p>
<p>; At least 12” away from another defence work</p>
<p>(measured from the centre).</p>
<p>; Not within or surrounded by Impassable terrain.</p>
<p>The Defender places either a Gun Turret or a Mortar, represented by a
circled <strong>G </strong>and a circled <strong>M</strong>,
respectively, on the scenario map, in any location within their
deployment zone. Once placed, neither of these can be moved during the
game. See the Field Artillery rules for the weapons’ profile and
specifications.</p>
<p>Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual way, using
models such as barricades, ruined buildings, trees, sandbags etc.</p>
<h3 id="infiltrators-6"><u>Infiltrators</u></h3>
<p>Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but they cannot be within
8” of any of the Defender’s Objective Buildings.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-6"><u>Deployment</u></h3>
<p>The player with the higher number of models is the Attacker. The
other deployment zone will be their opponent’s, as the Defender, with
half the number of models the Attacker has declared.</p>
<p>The Defender starts by deploying their models and also placing the
Gun Turret (or Mortar) where they wish according to the parameters set
below. After the Defender has deployed their models, the Attacker
deploys theirs.</p>
<p>Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone.</p>
<p>Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the
battle begins.</p>
<h3 id="battle-length-6"><u>Battle Length</u></h3>
<p>At the end of the fifth turn, the Attacker rolls 1D6. On a roll of
1-2, the battle ends. Otherwise, the game lasts for six turns.</p>
<h3 id="unforeseen-events"><u>Unforeseen Events</u></h3>
<p>These rules represent the treacherous and often unforeseeable tides
of war that can suddenly shift the battle unexpectedly. Starting on the
second turn of combat, roll 1D6. On a roll of 1-3, a random event
occurs, otherwise the game continues until the start of the next turn,
when another roll will be required. These events will always occur at
the start of the combat turn, before any model Activation (unless stated
otherwise). Upon the occurrence of a random event, roll another 1D6 for
the Unforeseen Events chart below to see what exactly happens and follow
the directions. No more than one random encounter will ever take place
in a single game, so after a random encounter is rolled, a player no
longer needs to roll at the start of a combat turn. The entries below
refer to the corresponding number rolled and its respective effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rising Fog</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Heavy fog covers the entire combat zone, drastically limiting
visibility for all models. All Ranged Attacks have their total range
halved, according to the weapon’s profile and respective modifiers that
may have been applied (such as scopes etc.) The fog lasts for two turns
before it dissipates.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Striding Mercenary</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Mercenary appears on the ridge overlooking the shore. Witnessing
the unfolding carnage, they decide to seize the opportunity and offer
their services to the warband with the most Glory Points currently
accumulated (if both warbands have the same number of points, roll-off
1D6 to see whom they offer their help to. On a roll of</p>
<p>1-3, the Attacker wins, and a roll of 4-6, the Defender wins the
roll-off ). The Mercenary will offer their services to the warband for a
single turn, even if they have already hired their maximum number of
Mercenary models for 1 Glory Point.</p>
<p>You can choose any of the Mercenary units available to your warband
and immediately deploy them at least 6” away from any other model in the
battlefield, but not within the opponent’s Deployment Zone. You can also
deny the Mercenary’s services if you don’t have the required amount of
points to pay them.</p>
<p>At the end of the turn, the warband that they aided must pay them
their required amount of Glory Points before they leave the battlefield.
If the warband cannot (or will not) meet the Mercenary’s standard, they
leave, but not before taking out their frustration on a random member of
the warband (only choose among members of the warband who haven’t been
taken Out of Action yet). Roll directly on the Injury Chart for this
member, according to the Mercenary’s profile statistics for the</p>
<p>attack (the opponent chooses which attack was used), applying any
applicable modifiers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Unearthed Relics</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Relics are suddenly unearthed in the battlefield. Each player places
two Objective Markers to represent the relics, for a total of four, each
at least 6” away from any Deployment Zone, at least 6” away from each
other and at least 6” away from any model. The relics cannot be placed
on impassable terrain or surrounded by it.</p>
<p>A model that comes into base contact with the relic claims it. The
model’s owner decides if it is a holy or unholy relic, according to the
restriction of their faction’s warband. The model either gains +1
<em>BLESSING MARKER </em>(for a holy relic) or starts radiating a
malignant aura and causes <em>FEAR </em>(for an unholy relic).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Beast of No Man’s Land</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The scent of blood soaking the ground and the incessant sound of
gunfire has brought the attention of a prowling beast. Rumours have been
spreading about this fiend. Some say it is a stray War Beast, a
hell-spawn abomination that escaped captivity before it could be made
into a War Wolf. Others claim it is something much older, something that
scarred the earth and fed upon its inhabitants long before the start of
the war. Whatever it is, the creature knows no bounds and sees neither
friend nor foe, only meat.</p>
<p>The Beast must be placed within 6” of a side of the board that is not
a Deployment Zone and at least 6” away from a Deployment Zone. The
players roll-off to determine on which side of the board the creature
will appear. The winning player chooses the board side and the losing
player places the creature where they deem fit, according to the
parameters above.</p>
<p>Note that the Beast cannot be initially placed anywhere within 12” of
a warband model.</p>
<p>At the end of each of a model’s Activation, the player must roll 1D6.
On a roll of 1-4, the Beast is Activated subsequently, before the
opponent activates one of their own models. The same player then acts
out the Beast’s actions, as described in its profile. If by the end of
the turn the Beast hasn’t been activated, it is before the start of the
next turn. The Beast can only be Activated once per turn. Below is the
Beast’s profile and special rules:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Beast | <strong>Movement</strong>: 8”/Infantry
<strong>Ranged</strong>: N/A | <strong>Melee</strong>: +2 Dice
<strong>Armour</strong>: 0 | <strong>Base</strong>: 120 x 80mm
<strong>Keywords</strong>: <em>FEAR</em>, <em>TOUGH</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The Beast model can be up to 60mm tall,
placed on a base of 120 x 80mm. It is armed only with its vicious Claws
and devastating Bite. These are natural</p>
<p>parts of the creature itself and cannot be removed or lost in any
way.</p>
<p>The Beast will seek out the nearest model with the most <em>BLOOD
MARKERS</em>, driven by its bloodthirsty frenzy. The Beast will Charge
the model through the fastest route and will Climb, Jump Over Gaps,
Between Ledges of Unequal Heights and Down (as long as the height won’t
cause an injury to it) to get at a warband model. However, note that it
will not move through Dangerous terrain if it can be avoided. The Beast
does not need to have line of sight of a model to Charge it. If the
beast cannot Charge a model, it will just Move toward the nearest
one.</p>
<p>When the Beast reaches a model, it will make one attack <em>ACTION
</em>with each of its Claws and one attack <em>ACTION </em>with its
Bite, all in Melee Combat (so it can make three attacks per Activation).
If the Beast Charges</p>
<p>more than one model, it will split its attacks amongst the
opponents.</p>
<p class="heading" id="equipment-54">Equipment</p>
<p>; <strong>Bite</strong>: The Beast treats its Bite as a melee weapon
that grants a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to hit (for a total of</p>
<p>+3D). Additionally, the attack ignores any armour worn by the target
and has a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to</p>
<p>injure. The Bite does not take any hands to wield.</p>
<p>; <strong>Claws</strong>: The Beast treats its Claws as two one-</p>
<p>handed melee weapons with the Keywords <em>RISKY</em>. The Claws have
a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to injure. Because the Claws are wielded
alongside the Bite, they are both treated as Off-Hand Weapons and suffer
penalties accordingly.</p>
<p class="heading" id="abilities-45">Abilities</p>
<p>; <strong>Resilient</strong>: The Beast is a massive creature with
unnatural vitality and is subject to the rules for <em>TOUGH
</em>creatures. Additionally, its hide is rough and thick, acting like
natural armour. Attacks made</p>
<p>against the Beast are made with <em>-1 DICE</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Unrelenting</strong>: The Beast may take its Dash and</p>
<p>any of its Jump <em>ACTIONS </em>with <em>+2 DICE</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Terrifying</strong>: The Beast is a horrid abomination</p>
<p>whose infamous repute has spread across many villages and towns
caught in the tides of war. Trench tales speak of the carnage and
desolation it leaves on its path, causing unfathomable
<em>FEAR</em>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rat Frenzy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rats have infested the trenches ever since the start of the war.
Troops wake up to the skittering of their little paws, the grinding of
their teeth gnawing and tearing at the dead, and even swarming upon the
living when the rotten flesh runs low and dry from the bones of the
fallen. The sounds of gunfight, the bombs detonating</p>
<p>upon the ground, the spreading of smoke and ash, and the disturbance
of the troops storming the shore has stirred the rats’ nest and the
pests now scurry out of their holes in a ravenous frenzy, feeding on
anything that stands in their way.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Use two templates of 80mm to represent the
Swarms of Rats. Use two Swarm of Rats’ models if you have them. The
players roll-off to place each Swarm</p>
<p>of Rats on the board. The Swarms must be placed within 8” of any
piece of terrain, including terrain within Deployment Zones, but cannot
be placed over Impassable terrain or surrounded by it, and cannot</p>
<p>be placed directly on top of another model or in base contact with
them. The Swarms must be placed at least 3” away from any warband
model.</p>
<p>The Swarms are considered Dangerous Terrain, with</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE </em>to injure. A model can Move through, start its Move
or end its movement on a Swarm. If a model comes into base contact with
a Swarm, they’re considered to be standing on Dangerous Terrain.</p>
<p>If a model armed with a weapon, or that has an ability with the
Keyword <em>FIRE </em>or <em>BLAST</em>, and that is not knocked Down,
comes into base contact with a Swarm, it can attempt a <em>RISKY ACTION
</em>to disperse the Swarm without triggering the Dangerous terrain
effect.</p>
<p>If successful, remove the Swarm from the game board and the
Activation of the model is over regardless of any remaining <em>ACTIONS
</em>the model might have.</p>
<p>Each Swarm moves 2D6” at the start of each combat turn, before the
Activation of any model. They will always move toward the nearest model
that is knocked Down or toward the nearest model that is not engaged in
melee combat and that is at least 6” away from any other model. The
Swarms cannot move toward a model that causes <em>FEAR</em>. The Swarm
must have line of sight to the model that is either knocked Down or
singled out in order to move toward them. If neither condition is met,
the Swarm does not move on that turn.</p>
<p>The Swarms cannot be engaged in any form of combat. The Swarms will
stay for D3 turns after which the rats will scurry back to their holes
and disappear.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Long Lost Stash</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The constant bombardment over the shore uncovers long lost stashes,
containing several weapons and items, the spoils of war. Each player
places one Objective Marker to represent these stashes to a total of
two, each at least 8” away from any Deployment Zone, at least</p>
<p>8” away from each other and at least 6” away from any model. The
stashes cannot be placed on impassable terrain or surrounded by it.</p>
<p>A model that comes into base contact with the stash claims it. The
model’s owner rolls 1D6 for a chance to get one of the following
items:</p>
<p><strong>1: </strong>A Trench Shield</p>
<p><strong>2: </strong>A Standard Armour</p>
<p><strong>3: </strong>Grenades</p>
<p><strong>4: </strong>A Medi-kit</p>
<p><strong>5: </strong>Armour Piercing Bullets (the model that claimed
the stash may, in this case only, use this item during this battle to
have its respective effect until the end of the game)</p>
<p><strong>6: </strong>A Grenade Launcher.</p>
<p>The model that claims the stash may immediately equip the item they
have looted for the duration of this game.</p>
<h3 id="victory-conditions-7"><u>Victory Conditions</u></h3>
<p>If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their Morale test,
the game ends and the opposing warband wins. Otherwise, keep a running
tally of Victory Points for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as
follows:</p>
<p>; The players score five VPs for each Objective Building that they
have taken control of. The Attacker scores two VPs for each Objective
Building</p>
<p>they have destroyed.</p>
<p>; The players control an Objective Building if the</p>
<p>total number of models from their warband (that are wholly within
that building) is higher than the total number of enemy models within 1”
of the Objective Building. A model is considered wholly within</p>
<p>a building if it is entirely within the edges of the</p>
<p>building’s footprint, as agreed by the players.</p>
<p>; The Attacker destroys an Objective Building if</p>
<p>at least one of their <em>ELITE </em>models that is wholly within the
building plants an explosive charge. The model can plant the explosive
charge with an Action (no roll required) but upon doing so, the
Activation of the model ends. In any following</p>
<p>turn, if the <em>ELITE </em>model is activated and moves at least 1”
outside the building’s footprint (previously accorded by the players),
the Objective Building is immediately destroyed and any other model
(friend or foe) that is still wholly within the building must
immediately roll on the Injury Chart, ignoring armour. If the <em>ELITE
</em>model is taken Out of Action before its next Activation, the
explosive charge does not go off.</p>
<p>If you are playing a Campaign, the Winner gains 5 Victory Points.</p>
<p>Calculate VPs at the end of the game for both players and add them
together. The player with the higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the
game is a draw.</p>
<p>However, the following conditions can alter the tides of battle,
granting the win regardless of the VPs a player may have
accumulated:</p>
<p>; If the Attacker takes control of the Main Structure Objective
Building for two full consecutive turns, they win the game regardless
of</p>
<p>the VPs the Defender may have.</p>
<p>; If the Defender takes all of the Attacker’s <em>ELITE</em></p>
<p>models Out of Action, they win the game regardless of the VPs the
Attacker may have.</p>
<p>If either of these two victory conditions are met at any point during
the game, it is considered a decisive win for the respective player and
the game immediately ends</p>
<h3 id="glorious-deeds-7"><u>Glorious Deeds</u></h3>
<p>Players score one Glory Point for every model that completes any of
the following Glorious Deeds. Glory Points for these can only be gained
once – whichever player completes them first gets the Glory Points!</p>
<p>; <strong>The Shore is Ours</strong>: As the Attacker, win the game
by taking control of the Main Structure Objective Building for two full
consecutive turns. Your last activated model to have entered the Main
Structure (and that was not taken Out of Action)</p>
<p>gains the Glory Point.</p>
<p>; <strong>The Head of the Snake</strong>: As the Defender, take</p>
<p>half of the Attacker’s <em>ELITE </em>models Out of Action</p>
<p>(rounded down) with the same model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Battlefield Legend</strong>: Take at least two enemy</p>
<p>models Out of Action with the same model during the battle with any
<em>ACTIONS </em>the model has, without suffering any <em>BLOOD
MARKERS</em>. If the model suffers a <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>but reduces
it back to zero, the count resets and the model is now eligible to score
this deed again if they meet the</p>
<p>necessary requirements stated above.</p>
<p>; <strong>Blood Cloud</strong>: Take at least three enemy models</p>
<p>Out of Action with one of your models using a</p>
<p>weapon with the Keyword <em>BLAST</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Cold Blooded Killer</strong>: Use 2+ <em>BLOOD</em></p>
<p><em>MARKERS </em>on a Melee Attack of one of your models to take an
enemy <em>ELITE </em>model Out of Action in a</p>
<p>single Activation.</p>
<p>; <strong>Ghost of Shores</strong>: Take an enemy <em>ELITE
</em>model</p>
<p>Out of Action with one of your models with the Keywords
<em>INFILTRATOR </em>or <em>SKIRMISHER</em>.</p>
<p>If agreed by the players prior to starting the game, you may replace
one of the Glory Deeds above for one of the following options:</p>
<p>; <strong>Rat Catcher</strong>: Disperse a Swarm of Rats that has
taken another model Out of Action, with a model armed with a weapon with
the Keyword <em>FIRE</em>.</p>
<p>; <strong>Bloody Beast</strong>: Take the Beast Out of Action</p>
<p>with a model that has at least 2+ <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em></p>
<p>at the start of its Activation.</p>

<h3 id="overview-2"><u>Overview</u></h3>
<p>Reports from the front lines tell of a massive entity tearing through
the afflicted, plague-ridden villages surrounding No Man’s Land. Some
claim it to be a newborn Larval Beast, a Possessed Tank, others an
Angelic creature gone rogue and some even say it is an actual Dragon.
The descriptions vary, but all agree on its immense size and the trail
of destruction and bloodshed it leaves behind. Showing no allegiance,
the creature has trampled warbands and strongholds alike, spreading
chaos indiscriminately. Hunting down “The Dragon,” as it has been named
in the scattered reports, has become a top priority. The warband that
claims its head will secure prestige and glory across the theatre of
war.</p>
<h3 id="forces-8"><u>Forces</u></h3>
<p>Both sides use their entire forces.</p>
<h3 id="the-battlefield-8"><u>The Battlefield</u></h3>
<p>The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we suggest 4’ x
4’).</p>
<p>Place a model on a base of at least 120mm to represent the Dragon at
the centre of the table, as indicated on the map by the Objective
Marker.</p>
<p>Each player then places three models each (that are on 25mm bases)
where they see fit. These represent</p>
<p>peasants. Note that the peasants must be placed at least 6” away from
another model, at least 8” away from the Dragon, at least 6” away from a
player’s deployment zone and cannot be placed on – or be surrounded by –
Impassable Terrain.</p>
<p>Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual way, using
models such as barricades, ruined buildings, trees, sandbags etc.</p>
<h3 id="infiltrators-7"><u>Infiltrators</u></h3>
<p>Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but they cannot be placed
within 8” of the Dragon model.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-7"><u>Deployment</u></h3>
<p>The players roll-off. The loser of the roll-off chooses which
deployment zone will be theirs. The other</p>
<p>deployment zone will be their opponent’s.</p>
<p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at a time,
starting with the player who has more models in their warband (roll-off
if both have the same number of models).</p>
<p>Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. If a
player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their
models afterwards. Once the players have set up their models, deployment
ends and the battle begins.</p>
<h3 id="battle-length-7"><u>Battle Length</u></h3>
<p>At the end of the fourth turn, a player rolls 1D6. On a roll of 1-2,
the battle ends. Otherwise, the game lasts for five turns.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon"><u>The Dragon</u></h3>
<p>The Dragon is activated once per turn. At the end of each of a
player’ model Activation, the player must roll a 1D6. On a roll of 5-6,
the Dragon is Activated</p>
<p>subsequently, before the opponent activates one of their own models.
The same player then acts out the Dragon’s actions, as described in its
profile. If by the end of the turn the Dragon hasn’t been activated, it
is before the start of the next turn. Below is the Dragon’s profile and
special rules:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: The Dragon | <strong>Movement</strong>:
10”/Infantry</p>
<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: +3 Dice | <strong>Melee</strong>: +3 Dice
<strong>Armour</strong>: -3 | <strong>Base</strong>: 120mm+
<strong>Keywords</strong>: <em>FEAR</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The Dragon’s model must be placed on a base
of at least 120mm and can go up to a 300mm base. You</p>
<p>can use a Larval Beast to proxy the model, or a Possessed Tank or
even an actual Dragon model. The larger the model is the better –
however, the less Movement it also has, according to the following
metrics:</p>
<p>; On a 120mm to 200mm base = Movement: 10”</p>
<p>; On a 210mm to 250mm base = Movement: 9”</p>
<p>; On a 260mm to 300mm base = Movement: 8”.</p>
<p>The Dragon is considered both an enemy model and as Difficult
Terrain. When in base contact with it, a warband model can Climb the
Dragon, Move through it, beneath it, on it and start or end its movement
beneath it or on it. Ideally, the Dragon’s model should</p>
<p>be big enough to allow for two models on a 60mm base to stand on top
of it (or up to four models on a 25mm base). A model that is on top of
the Dragon rolls with</p>
<p><em>+1 DICE </em>to hit it and <em>+1 DICE </em>to injure it.
However, note that all <em>ACTIONS </em>taken by a model on top of</p>
<p>the Dragon are considered as <em>RISKY</em>. Additionally, when the
Dragon uses its Move, any model on top of it must immediately succeed at
a <em>RISKY ACTION</em>. On a fail, the model is forcibly moved 2” in a
direction of the opponent’s choice and is knocked Down. If this</p>
<p>movement forces the model to fall from the Dragon, the model’s owner
must also roll on the Injury Chart, as per the rules of Falling.</p>
<p>When Activated, the Dragon will Move towards the nearest Peasant
model via the fastest route possible. The Dragon cannot Charge as usual.
Instead, if its movement takes it into contact with a model it counts as
charging and engages that model in melee combat, if that is the Dragon’s
intended target. When moving</p>
<p>toward a targeted model, if the Dragon comes into base contact with
another model that it is not targeting, it does not engage in melee
combat with it, even if the model intends to engage it. Instead, the
Dragon will run right over them. Any model moved over by the Dragon
suffers an injury. The player controlling the Dragon immediately rolls
on the Injury Chart with <em>+1 DICE </em>to injure, for any models
trampled by the Dragon.</p>
<p>When attacked by a warband model, the Dragon will seek out the last
warband model that attacked it on its next Activation. The Dragon will
Move toward the model via the fastest route possible (even through</p>
<p>certain impassable terrain pieces, if possible. See below). The
Dragon ignores movement penalties and effects caused by Difficult
Terrain and Dangerous Terrain. If the last model that attacked the
Dragon is on top of it, or if the Dragon cannot reach the model that
attacked it in one Activation, on its next Activation it will shift its
focus to either move toward the nearest Peasant model, the last model
that attacked it or to leave the area. If the Dragon attacks a targeted
model at the start of its turn, it will then use its Movement to either
move toward the nearest Peasant model or to leave the area.</p>
<p>Note that the Dragon does not need to have line of sight to a model
to Move toward it.</p>
<p>If there are no more Peasant models present on the table before the
end of the game, having either escaped the area (see the Peasant
section) or been taken Out of Action, the Dragon will shift its focus to
leave the area to continue its rampage elsewhere, using its Movement
when Activated to reach the nearest edge of the table.</p>
<p>If the Dragon comes into base contact with any of the table’s edges,
it successfully leaves the area. See the Victory Conditions section.
Note that the Dragon cannot Dash.</p>
<p>The Dragon’s limbs function as its weapons. It is armed with its
Stomp, its Tail Swipe and its Fire Breath. These are parts of the
creature itself and cannot be removed</p>
<p>or lost in any way. When the Dragon comes into base contact with a
model that it has targeted, it will make two attack <em>ACTIONS
</em>with its Stomp in Melee Combat (so it can make two attacks per
Activation with this weapon).</p>
<p>If the Dragon engages in Melee combat with multiple models, it will
make one attack <em>ACTION </em>against each model, with its Tail Swipe
instead (see below). However, after the Dragon is knocked Down twice, as
per its Undying special rule (see below), it loses its tail, meaning
that it cannot use its Tail Swipe attack any longer.</p>
<p>If the Dragon’s movement does not get it into Melee range of a model,
or if the model moves away from its Melee range but remains within range
to use its Fire Breath, it attacks once with it instead in Ranged
Combat.</p>
<p class="heading" id="equipment-55">Equipment</p>
<p>; <strong>Stomp</strong>: The Dragon treats its Stomp as a melee
weapon that grants a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to hit (for total of <em>+4
DICE</em>). Additionally, the attack ignores any armour worn by the
target and has a <em>+1 DICE </em>bonus to injure. The Stomp takes one
“hand” to</p>
<p>wield.</p>
<p>; <strong>Fire Breath</strong>: The Dragon treats its Fire Breath
as</p>
<p>a ranged weapon with 10” range. It hits up to two models within range
automatically with the Attack <em>ACTION </em>as long as they are within
6” of each other. This attack has the Keyword <em>FIRE</em>, so it
causes an additional +1 <em>BLOOD MARKER </em>on enemies it hits, even
if no other damage is caused. Additionally, the attack ignores any
armour worn by the target. The</p>
<p>Fire Breath does not take any hands to wield.</p>
<p>; <strong>Tail Swipe</strong>: The Dragon treats its Tail Swipe as
a</p>
<p>melee weapon. This weapon has the same rules as a two-handed hammer
but its huge reach means that the Dragon may make one Melee Attack
<em>ACTION </em>against each enemy model it is fighting in Melee.</p>
<p class="heading" id="abilities-46">Abilities</p>
<p>; <strong>Undying</strong>: The Dragon is an extremely resilient
opponent. If a model’s attack would take the Dragon Out of Action, it is
knocked Down instead. Every time the Dragon is knocked Down this way,
any <em>BLOOD MARKERS </em>it may have are removed. Use a dice to match
the corresponding number of times the Dragon has been knocked Down. The
Dragon must then be knocked Down in this way two more times (for a total
of three) before it can be taken Out of Action. However, note that on
its last “life”, the Dragon can only be taken Out of Action then
when</p>
<p>it accumulates six <em>BLOOD MARKERS</em>. These <em>BLOOD</em></p>
<p><em>MARKERS </em>can then be used to cause a Blood Bath or to add
<em>+DICE </em>to kill the Dragon.</p>
<p>; <strong>Resistant</strong>: At the start of each of its

to the metrics above, when the Dragon moves it will pass over it,
crumbling the structure completely. Remove the piece from the board –
the area where it was becomes Difficult Terrain the same size as the
building was. Additionally, any model that is wholly within the
building’s footprint (previously accorded by the players) when it
crumbles must immediately</p>

<h3 id="the-peasants"><u>The Peasants</u></h3>
<p>The villages surrounding the frontlines have been tainted by all
sorts of maladies and misfortune. The war has taken its toll on the
peasantry, many of which are contaminated with never seen before
afflictions. Hence the main reason why they have not been evacuated from
the battlefield. However, their taint has attracted the attention of the
Dragon. Rescuing them is not an option. They pose a great risk to the
troops.</p>
<p>So, putting an end to their miserable lives is the only right thing
to do and the order that every warband sent to claim the Dragon’s head
has been given to by their higher ups.</p>
<p>All Peasants are deployed at the start of the game (see the
Battlefield section). Each Peasant is activated once per turn. At the
end of each of a player’ model Activation, the same player also
Activates a Peasant model anywhere on the table that hasn’t been
Activated yet. The player then acts out the Peasant’s actions, as
described in its profile. The players alternate between Activating the
Peasants until all have been Activated in that turn. Below is the
Peasant’s profile and special rules:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Peasant | <strong>Movement</strong>:
5”/Infantry</p>
<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: N/A | <strong>Melee</strong>: N/A</p>
<p><strong>Armour</strong>: 0 | <strong>Base</strong>: 25mm</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The Peasant has no attacks, equipment or
abilities. They can only Move, as per their normal Movement, and cannot
Dash. When Activated, a Peasant will always try to move as far away as
possible from the Dragon, toward one of the table’s edges. In this path,
they should also try to keep as much distance as</p>
<p>possible from any warband model. However, note that the Peasant will
not Move into Dangerous Terrain and will also try to avoid Difficult
Terrain, if possible.</p>
<p>If a Peasant comes into base contact with any of the table’s edges,
it successfully leaves the area. Remove the corresponding Peasant model
from the board.</p>
<p>The afflicted peasantry’s feeble nature makes them vulnerable in any
confrontation. Attacks made against a Peasant are made with <em>+2 DICE
</em>to Hit and <em>+2 DICE </em>to injure.</p>

<h3 id="victory-conditions-8"><u>Victory Conditions</u></h3>
<p>If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their Morale test,
the game ends and the opposing warband wins. Otherwise, keep a running
tally of Victory Points for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as
follows:</p>
<p>; A player scores four VPs for each time they knock Down the Dragon
with one of their warband models.</p>
<p>; A player scores six VPs for taking the Dragon</p>
<p>Out of Action with one of their warband models.</p>
<p>; A player scores two VPs for each Peasant taken</p>
<p>Out of Action by one of their warband models. If a Peasant model
escapes the area, neither player gains the VPs for that model.</p>
<p>Calculate VPs at the end of the game for both players and add them
together. The player with the higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the
game is a draw. However, the following condition can bring the game to
an immediate end, regardless of the VPs the players may have
accumulated:</p>
<p>; If the Dragon successfully leaves the battlefield, neither of the
players win the game, regardless of the VPs they may have accumulated up
until this point. Take into account only the Glorious Deeds performed,
if any, and award no VPs.</p>
<h3 id="glorious-deeds-8"><u>Glorious Deeds</u></h3>
<p>Players score one Glory Point for every model that completes any of
the following Glorious Deeds. Glory Points for these can only be gained
once – whichever player completes them first gets the Glory Points!</p>
<p>; <strong>Dragon Slayer</strong>: Take the Dragon Out of Action with
one of your models (that is on top of it) using a melee weapon. This
Deed is worth two Glory</p>
<p>Points.</p>
<p>; <strong>Genocidal</strong>: Take at least three Peasants Out of</p>
<p>Action with the same model.</p>
<p>; <strong>Opportunist</strong>: Use a Peasant during its
Activation</p>
<p>to lure the Dragon into moving over an enemy</p>
<p>model. Your model whose turn was prior to the Peasant’s gains the
Glory Point.</p>
<p>; <strong>Off My Back</strong>: Make an enemy model that is on</p>
<p>top of the Dragon fall due to your action (shooting,</p>
<p>melee, Supernatural Power etc).</p>
<p>; <strong>Fire with Fire</strong>: Inflict 2+ <em>BLOOD MARKERS
</em>on</p>
<p>the Dragon with the same model, using a weapon with either the
Keyword <em>FIRE</em>, <em>GAS </em>or <em>SHRAPNEL</em>.</p>

<p>These rules can be used to generate either one-off or Campaign
scenarios on the fly. To Generate a Scenario, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>One player rolls for Scenario type on the chart below.</p></li>
<li><p>One player rolls for Deployment type on the chart below.</p></li>
<li><p>Both players roll for Glorious Deeds on the charts
below.</p></li>
<li><p>Players set up Terrain according to the instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Players deploy their troops according to instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the Length of the Game as detailed below.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-up"><u>Setting Up</u></h3>
<p>Unless the scenario instructs otherwise, the players take it in turns
to deploy one model at a time, starting with the player who has more
models in their warband (roll- off if both have the same number of
models).</p>
<p>Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. If a
player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their
models afterwards. Once the players have set up their models, deployment
ends and the battle begins.</p>
<p>When a model that is not set up on the playing area moves onto the
table, measure the move from its entry point as determined in the
scenario.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-2"><u>Terrain</u></h3>
<p>Set up terrain as explained in the terrain section of the book. It is
important for any battlefield to have enough terrain to block Line of
Sight at regular intervals so that the game does not turn into a battle
where only long- range weapons matter. Both players should set up an
equal number of terrain pieces.</p>
<h3 id="game-length"><u>Game Length</u></h3>
<p>At the end of the fifth turn of the game, one of the players rolls a
D6. If the result is 4 or more, the game ends. If the game continues,
the game ends at the end of the sixth turn.</p>
<h3 id="roll-for-scenario-type"><u>Roll for Scenario Type</u></h3>
<p>After terrain has been placed, either player rolls a D6 and consults
the chart below to determine the victory conditions for the game.
<strong>Note </strong>that if you are playing the campaign, the winner
always gains 5 Victory Points if otherwise the result would indicate
less.</p>
<p>Scenario Chart (roll a D6)</p>
<h3 id="scenario-objective-1-attritional-battle"><u>Scenario Objective
1: Attritional Battle</u></h3>
<p>At the end of the game, each player totals up the ducat value of
their enemy models that they have taken Out of Action and divides the
number by 100, rounding any fractions up to find the number of Victory
Points each player has scored. Troops bought with Glory Points are</p>
<p>worth 30 ducats per Glory Point for this calculation. The highest
scoring player wins. You gain +1 Victory Point for each enemy you kill
on the opposing half of the table from your own.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-objective-2"><u>Scenario Objective 2:</u></h3>
<p><u>Take and Hold</u></p>
<p>Each player rolls D3+1 and takes that many 1” radius Objective
markers. The player with the most objective markers (or the winner of a
roll-off, if both players have the same number of markers) begins by
placing one of their Objective markers on the playing surface. Then the
opponent does the same and they keep alternating until both players have
placed all of their Objective markers. Objective markers can be placed
anywhere on</p>
<p>the playing surface outside Impassable Terrain, and more than 8” away
from another marker, table edge or any Deployment Zone. If it becomes
impossible to place any more markers, the remaining markers are
discarded.</p>
<p>To hold an objective, a player must have a model within 3” of the
marker and there must be no enemy models</p>
<p>at all within 3” of the same marker. If either of these conditions is
not met, that objective is not held by any player.</p>
<p>After the game ends, the players determine how many objectives they
control. The player with the most objective markers wins. If they hold
the same number of objectives, the game is a draw.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-objective-3-sabotage"><u>Scenario Objective 3:
Sabotage</u></h3>
<p>Each player places objectives, as described for Mission</p>
<p>2. Then the players roll-off and the winner decides to be the
attacker or defender. During the game, the attacker can destroy the
objectives by planting mines/demolition charges or other explosives on
them.</p>
<p>To plant an explosive charge on an objective, any attacking model
must first move into base contact with</p>
<p>the objective marker and then use any melee attack <em>ACTION
</em>they have on the objective – this automatically plants the charges
and the Activation of the model ends. In any following turn, if the
attacking model</p>
<p>is activated and moves away from the marker, the objective is
automatically destroyed and any other model (friends and foes) that is
still in base contact with the objective must immediately roll on the
Injury Chart while ignoring armour. If the model moves away from the
marker or is taken Out of Action before its next Activation, the
explosive charge does not go off.</p>
<p>After the game ends, if the attacker has destroyed more objectives
than their opponent, the Attacker wins. If less, then the Attacker
loses. If both players have destroyed exactly the same number of the
objectives, the game is a draw.</p>
<p>Infiltrators must be deployed as normal troops.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-objective-4"><u>Scenario Objective 4:</u></h3>
<p><u>Over the Top</u></p>
<p>Both players place four 8”+ long trench sections in their own
deployment zone, at least 3” away from the nearest other trench. At the
end of the battle, players score 1 Victory Point for each of their own
trenches they hold where there are no enemy models in the same trench
section. They gain 1 Victory Point for each enemy trench they have that
has at least one of their own models and 2 VPs if there are no enemy
models in the trench.</p>
<p>If you roll a Chance Encounter as a Deployment type, roll again until
you get a different one.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-objective-5-breakthrough"><u>Scenario Objective 5:
Breakthrough</u></h3>
<p>After rolling for setup type, and just before starting the Setup
Warbands step, the players roll off and the winner picks any of the four
table edges for their opponent to escape from. Then the opponent does
the same, but they cannot pick the same table edge picked by the first
player.</p>
<p>Any model that moves into contact with the ‘extraction point,’ which
is the point in the exact centre of the chosen table edge, is removed
and counts as escaped. If enemy models are placed to block the
extraction point, models can escape as near as possible to the
extraction point, on either side of the blocking models.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, each player totals up the</p>
<p>ducat value of their own models that have escaped the battlefield and
divides the number by 100, rounding any fractions up to find the number
of Victory Points each player has scored. Troops bought with Glory
Points are worth 30 ducats per Glory Point for this calculation. The
highest scoring player wins.</p>
<p>Scenario Objective 6: <u>Retrieve</u></p>
<p>Move the area of dense terrain (of at least 6” x 6” and that is
closest to the centre of the table) so that it is in the centre of the
table, and then place an objective marker on it, exactly in the centre
of the table. This marker represents a small object, like relic or an
artefact, lost experimental weapon etc.</p>
<p>During the game, any model that ends its move in contact with the
marker picks it up. That model is now carrying the object and will carry
it until it leaves the table or is destroyed. As long as it is carrying
the object, the model cannot Attack and cannot Dash and no other method
of movement (teleportation, Puppet Master etc.) can be used to move the
model due the mystical effect of the relic! At the end of its
activation, the model can pass the object to any friendly model within
1” range, as long as neither model is in melee combat with an enemy. The
model receiving the object is considered to have ended their Activation
this turn, if it has not have done so yet.</p>
<p>If the model carrying the object is taken Out of Action the object is
immediately thrown D6” in a direction indicated by the opposing player,
though never out of the battlefield. Stop if the object moves into
contact with Impenetrable Terrain just outside it. If it lands on
top</p>
<p>of a model, the model immediately picks it up, except if there is
also an enemy model in melee combat with it, in which case it is thrown
again.</p>
<p>If the model carrying the object moves into contact with any table
edge, it has escaped with the object and the player immediately wins the
game.</p>
<p>If the game ends while a model is carrying the object, the players
roll off with D6 one last time. If the player controlling the model
carrying the objective wins the roll-off, they win the game. In any
other case, the game is a draw.</p>
<p>Infiltrators must be deployed as normal troops.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><u>Chance Encounter</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The players roll-off and the winner chooses which long table side
belongs to them (or any edge if you are playing on a square area). The
opponent gets the opposite</p>
<p>table edge (see diagram). Models are not set up on the table at the
start of the game. Instead, on the first</p>
<p>turn of the game, half of the warband (selected by each player)
enters the battlefield. When one of the models is activated, it starts
its move onto the table from any point along the player’s table edge,
though it cannot be deployed directly into melee combat. In turn two,
the rest of the warband is deployed exactly the same way.</p>
<p>The scenario with Chance Encounter deployment lasts for a minimum of
six turns.</p>
