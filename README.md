# 📖 Trench Bible Maker

> *"In the trenches, faith and war have been intertwined for centuries. From the fresh recruit to the most seasoned general, even among the Heretic Legions, every soldier carries one personal object—their own Trench Bible. Over time, the term Trench Bible has become a common expression, encompassing all sacred books carried into the battlefield—whether it be the Bible, the Quran, or the Hebraic holy scriptures. Whether richly adorned, bound in rusted metal, or reduced to a handful of battle-worn pages, it is a deeply personal artifact, often shaped by its owner's beliefs, history, and the harsh reality of war."*
